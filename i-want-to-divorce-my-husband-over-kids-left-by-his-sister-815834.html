This is&nbsp;what happened with a&nbsp;woman from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit</a> who decided to&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> her husband because of&nbsp;kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8a/0b3/603627526cad1e2334d3dad005.jpg><p>I&nbsp;(F29) knew from a&nbsp;young age&nbsp;I didn’t ever want to&nbsp;have or&nbsp;raise <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>children</a>. I&nbsp;met my&nbsp;husband in&nbsp;college, and he&nbsp;was decidedly child-free too. We&nbsp;got married a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years back.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband’s younger sister (F24) has three kids (M5, M&nbsp;& F&nbsp;2) with different deadbeat guys. Two months ago she left all of&nbsp;them at&nbsp;our house, said she was going on&nbsp;an&nbsp;errand and never came back. Just left. We&nbsp;filed a&nbsp;report and everything. Last we&nbsp;heard she was safe but did not want to&nbsp;come back.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband’s mom is&nbsp;a&nbsp;minimum-wage worker barely scraping&nbsp;by. She used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mom and did not want to&nbsp;raise these kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b4/926/7090a55393b5107df041bd712f.jpg><p>I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;raise them <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>either</a>. Don’t get me&nbsp;wrong, I&nbsp;feel bad for them. But raising kids is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge responsibility&nbsp;I don’t want to&nbsp;take&nbsp;up.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;months they were here, our expense has increased, we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;buy them <a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a> and stuff, and they are sleeping in&nbsp;our living room on&nbsp;air mattresses (we&nbsp;only have one bedroom). I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;work from home and look after them cause my&nbsp;husband could not get them and daycare for 3&nbsp;is expensive. It&nbsp;has been really rough, to&nbsp;say the least.</p><p>CPS did get involved and asked&nbsp;us whether we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;keep the kids or&nbsp;not. I&nbsp;do not. I&nbsp;thought my&nbsp;husband would be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the same page, but he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;keep the kids. CPS has asked&nbsp;us to&nbsp;decide quickly and make necessary changes (get a&nbsp;bigger home for one).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/161/f96/93bc2155ecae8c726d3f47c94a.jpg><p>My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have gone back and forth on&nbsp;this. I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cannot</a> live the next 16&nbsp;years like this. Raising kids is&nbsp;hard. And expensive. But he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there for his family. Which I&nbsp;get.</p><p>So&nbsp;yesterday&nbsp;I told him&nbsp;I want a&nbsp;divorce. Quickly, before he&nbsp;made any commitments and dragged me&nbsp;into it&nbsp;with him. He&nbsp;got offended that&nbsp;I divorced him over kids. For abandoning him when he&nbsp;needed&nbsp;me.</p><p>I&nbsp;told him he&nbsp;knew my&nbsp;boundaries well in&nbsp;advance and this was a&nbsp;commitment (children) that he&nbsp;was unilaterally deciding&nbsp;on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e6/bf6/281ce5513cb8ddf7d8c9a3ec84.jpg><p>It’s obvious that both suffer from this situation since the man didn’t expect that his sister would disappear. And he&nbsp;cannot leave his nephews and niece and the woman didn’t want to&nbsp;have kids, but now she has to&nbsp;raise them. People online also expressed different points of&nbsp;view on&nbsp;it.</p><ul><li>It’s not surprising that your husband wouldn’t want to&nbsp;put his nephew/nieces in&nbsp;foster care after a&nbsp;situation that there was no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;predict. There are horror stories all over the Internet and news about the broken foster system.<br>That said you vehemently don’t want kids and if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;something you’re unwilling to&nbsp;take&nbsp;on (which is&nbsp;absolutely your right) then <strong>it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;better to&nbsp;end it&nbsp;before the resentment of&nbsp;the situation</strong> takes over your life. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hawkfan4_life&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li><strong>Forcing someone into parenthood is&nbsp;also </strong><i><strong>bad for those children</strong></i>. If&nbsp;you are ill-equipped or&nbsp;unwilling, those children will be&nbsp;the ones who suffer from&nbsp;it. They deserve parents who want them wholeheartedly, and nothing less. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cypresscoydog&nbsp;/ Reddit</a><br></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/421/2b8/32019b5beb8ecb9b905b4a1f1d.jpg><ul><li>Like what’s her husband supposed to&nbsp;do? He&nbsp;could very well still not want kids, but of&nbsp;course, he’s not going to&nbsp;abandon those poor kids in&nbsp;foster care. He’s stuck with this situation and could very well feel just as&nbsp;upset about it&nbsp;as&nbsp;the woman does. And now he&nbsp;has to&nbsp;deal with it&nbsp;all alone.<br>Like I&nbsp;get&nbsp;it. She shouldn’t be&nbsp;there if&nbsp;she’s going to&nbsp;resent them but... I&nbsp;don’t know. <strong>I&nbsp;feel for her husband in&nbsp;this situation</strong>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>starryeyedq&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Imagine as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child that your dad leaves, then your mom leaves you, your grandma can’t take you in&nbsp;and then your uncle and auntie give you&nbsp;up... The woman got dealt an&nbsp;awful hand, but <strong>the kids got dealt an&nbsp;even worse one</strong>. Terrible situation all around but you can’t really fault an&nbsp;uncle for not giving up&nbsp;on&nbsp;his nieces and nephews just like that. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>throwAwayfor****sand&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Which side will you take? Caring for children is&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant responsibility, and finding someone who may help with it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;challenging. Many parents turn to&nbsp;those they trust the most. For instance, another <a href=#>online</a> user has shared a&nbsp;story where she faced a&nbsp;last-minute babysitting request from her sister.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuw8Cnq2asn2KxqsLOq5qeZZ2ueqnB0puYp5xdpMOmvoykoJ2rXaGyp8CMm7BmoJmoerS10q2cq2VoZoJ5f5No</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
