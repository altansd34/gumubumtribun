The duo collaborated for a holiday duet of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.”</p><p>“We hadn’t seen each other in five years, which is a long time. We reunited at her party a few months ago and then she heard my album and she was playing it in LA traffic and she loved it so much that she wanted to hop on it,” she said.</p><p>In a previous interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a> in November, Dinah admitted that she was “nervous” to reach out to Ally for the duet. For Brooke, however, enlisting the former bandmate for the collab is not even a question.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is the first time that any members of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fifth Harmony</a> have reunited on a song since going on hiatus in 2018. The release was a surprise track added to Brooke’s Under the Tree holiday EP.</p><p>The collection was first released in November 3 consisting of four songs, including a solo version of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.” On December 1, the duo released the song alongside a festive music video.</p><p>Ahead of the release, Brooke shared her aspirations for a Fifth Harmony reunion. According to the “Work From Home” singer, there have been some healing relationships between the girl band.</p><p>“I want to reunite with some of the others, but that’s happening inch by inch, and we’re having different discussions about possible Fifth Harmony adventures ahead. But that’s all I can say. It’s really amazing that we’re able to reunite with each other and build those relationships again,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-talks-navigating-music-career-as-a-solo-artist>She Talks Navigating Music Career as a Solo Artist</h2><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Brooke talked about trekking a solo career after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fifth Harmony</a> disbandment. As per the “Low Key” hitmaker, it feels “amazing” that she gets to do things on her own terms now.</p><p>“It’s pretty awesome,” she said. “I love being in charge of my career, of my music, having the team that I’ve wanted for a long time. It’s been amazing, I get to be in control of my art and what I love to do.”</p><p>Brooke went on and stated that having a Christmas EP is one of the “liberating” aspects of going solo.</p><p>“It’s been such a goal for so long, since I was little, to have a Christmas album, and I finally have a Christmas EP,” she previously told EP. “Me and my family just love the holidays, and it’s so meaningful for me. I mean, it’s my favorite time of the year, so to have a Christmas EP after all the time that has passed, it’s magical, it really is.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_MatFranco_JimSpellman_WireImage-220x147.jpg alt="Remembering All of Mat Franco’s Magical Performances on ‘America’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaKdraBdna6zuc6nsKxlkaG5unnBq6aoo5VisabAwKKjrGWimsKvtdOipaBlp57BqXnDoqWaoF2bvLN506GcoqpdmLWztdKtpJqrXZi8rbjAm2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
