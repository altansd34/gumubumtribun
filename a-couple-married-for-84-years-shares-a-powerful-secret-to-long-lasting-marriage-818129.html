They are potentially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recognized</a> as&nbsp;the longest-married couple in&nbsp;the entire nation. Their remarkable journey spans over eight decades, a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the profound <a href=# title=bond data-link=tag>bond</a> they share and the enduring secret to&nbsp;their union.<br></p><p><h2>Their love story began in&nbsp;1939.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/feb/e24/ff8c0757c6a5bc2e661a66841a.jpg><p>Cleovis and Arwilda’s first encounter took place when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;13, and she was merely 9&nbsp;years old. Recalling the moment, Arwilda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> it&nbsp;as&nbsp;happening «in&nbsp;the fork of&nbsp;a&nbsp;road.»</p><p>Cleovis often found himself in&nbsp;the company of&nbsp;his stepbrother Elmo, who had special needs. Elmo had a&nbsp;habit of&nbsp;approaching young girls and grabbing their hands, a&nbsp;behavior Cleovis, being taller, would intervene to&nbsp;stop, as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recounted</a> by&nbsp;the couple’s daughter, Kathy Whiteside-Sims.</p><p>One particular day, as&nbsp;Arwilda was walking along the road, her friend advised her to&nbsp;seek refuge with the taller boy, Cleovis, assuring her that he&nbsp;would protect her. When Arwilda sought shelter with him, Cleovis felt a&nbsp;strong sense that she would be&nbsp;his future wife.</p><p>Their paths crossed again at&nbsp;a&nbsp;church event where girls and women prepared boxed suppers for local boys and men to&nbsp;purchase. It&nbsp;was there that Cleovis bought Arwilda’s boxed supper for 40&nbsp;cents, a&nbsp;gesture that left a&nbsp;lasting impression.</p><p>Additionally, they attended the same school, a&nbsp;one-room institution where children of&nbsp;various ages, including older sharecroppers, gathered irregularly.</p><p>Their journey together officially began on&nbsp;July&nbsp;24, 1939, when Arwilda and Cleovis <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exchanged</a> vows and embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;lifelong commitment.</p><p><h2>The Whitesides were also known for their generous contributions to&nbsp;raising children beyond their own.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17a/9ba/d480a25d158074813f1f1318e0.jpg><p>Life circumstances led Cleovis and Arwilda to&nbsp;endure periods of&nbsp;separation, notably when Cleovis <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>departed</a> in&nbsp;the early 1940s to&nbsp;army service. Upon his return in&nbsp;1945, he&nbsp;pursued studies in&nbsp;auto mechanics at&nbsp;Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical &&nbsp;Normal College.</p><p>Cleovis’s enrollment in&nbsp;school came unexpectedly, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;traveled over 60&nbsp;miles from Clarendon to&nbsp;Pine Bluff to&nbsp;enlist, only to&nbsp;be&nbsp;instructed to&nbsp;begin immediately, according to&nbsp;his daughter. «He&nbsp;wasn’t able to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back home to&nbsp;Clarendon,» Whiteside-Sims <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>. «It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;process of&nbsp;calling somebody to&nbsp;call somebody to&nbsp;go&nbsp;and tell somebody, ’I’m not coming home. I’m in&nbsp;school.’»</p><p>Following his education, Cleovis secured employment at&nbsp;the Pine Bluff Arsenal, while Arwilda dedicated herself to&nbsp;homemaking and caring for their children. Throughout their marriage, the couple embraced the responsibility of&nbsp;raising their own 12&nbsp;children, while also offering support to&nbsp;other local children in&nbsp;need of&nbsp;shelter.</p><p>«Sometimes they had children that lived with them,» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> Dean from the Arkansas <a href=# title=Family data-link=tag>Family</a> Council. «They were just pillars in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=community data-link=tag>community</a>.»</p><p>Arwilda admires her husband’s generosity immensely. «He&nbsp;is&nbsp;always trying to&nbsp;help people,» she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>.</p><p>When asked about his favorite aspect of&nbsp;his wife, Cleovis couldn’t narrow it&nbsp;down to&nbsp;just one thing. Instead, he&nbsp;lovingly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, «I&nbsp;love&nbsp;99% of&nbsp;her,» encapsulating his deep affection for Arwilda.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;powerful secret to&nbsp;long-lasting marriage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d1/710/1ec9445023a527570570abf274.jpg><p>Since 1939, Cleovis, aged 102, and Arwilda, aged&nbsp;98, have been reflecting on&nbsp;their decades-long marriage, attributing their success to&nbsp;a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;inner strength and resilience. «We&nbsp;can hardly believe this is&nbsp;happening to&nbsp;us because we&nbsp;feel like, we&nbsp;were the least,» Arwilda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> that something greater guided them through the life.</p><p>A&nbsp;powerful secret to&nbsp;their long-lasting marriage is&nbsp;to&nbsp;have unwavering belief, learn to&nbsp;persevere, and cultivate a&nbsp;deep sense of&nbsp;inner strength. Arwilda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, «That is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;take you through all kinds of&nbsp;storms.» This advice, stemming from the couple’s 84&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage, is&nbsp;directed at&nbsp;couples contemplating marriage in&nbsp;the near future.</p><p>The Whitesides have shared a&nbsp;life full of&nbsp;love and family, having <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>raised</a> 12&nbsp;children, 45&nbsp;grandchildren, 91&nbsp;great-grandchildren, and 27&nbsp;great-great-grandchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5ur86up6WdXaKus77Inptmnp%2BnenmAjLKcmqqjYsCprdGeqmaZXaW8uLHRn6ylZaOasLOx02arqGWcpLuoecuaqq2hnpx6rq3Rq6Can5VihXKEkGtwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
