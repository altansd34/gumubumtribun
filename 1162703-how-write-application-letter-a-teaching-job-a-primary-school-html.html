Therefore, creating a positive impression is critical if you want to be shortlisted for interviews. One sure way of doing so is through a well-written application letter.</p><h2>What is a job application letter?</h2><p class=align-left>An application or cover letter summarises your strongest and most relevant skills and abilities that will be expanded in your resume or during the interview. It introduces you to potential employers and highlights your suitability for the position you are applying for.</p><h2>How to write an application letter</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/55af12d60d92ab51.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does relevant experience mean on a resume?

A letter helps you project a particular impression of who you are before presenting yourself for interviews. Therefore, this is a critical stage that you must fully capitalise on. Here are some factors to consider when penning these kinds of letters.</p><h3>Make it official</h3><p class=align-left>For any job seeker, especially those intending to join white-collar jobs such as teaching, knowing how to write an official letter is a must. Therefore, your job application letter must have the following characteristics.</p><ul><li>Your contact information and date;</li><li>Employer's postal address;</li><li>Salutations;</li><li>The body paragraphs;</li><li>The closing paragraph;</li><li>The sign-off.</li></ul><p class=align-left>So, if you want to know how to write an application letter in Nigeria, look no further as the structure is not any different. It has to contain the above features.</p><h3>Put the accent on your achievements</h3><p class=align-left>Prior to sending your application letter for a job vacancy, consider this essential step. To impress your potential employer, make sure you highlight your successes and achievements at your former institution and previous jobs. Make sure you show your teaching certificates and credential skills.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1e0b0029d23f5024.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best advice and samples of how to write a resignation letter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tell them how you applied your knowledge in practice. You probably have some recognition of excellence, like an award. There is nothing wrong with showing off your achievements. Every employer wants to hire professional and successful teachers. That said, please note that you should not add too many specific details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/55af12d60d92ab51.png><h2>Write your application carefully and take your time</h2><p class=align-left>A simple job application letter may not be an essential part of some employers' views because some consider job experience to be more important than the ability to express yourself.</p><p class=align-left>However, it does not mean that you can make spelling mistakes or write the letter poorly. Sit back and read how to write an application letter carefully, apply the knowledge you have gained from your research, and make sure your own letter is correct and professional. Do not make a wrong impression at an early stage during the application for employment.</p><h2>Highlight your other qualifications</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a3a377b272fc570b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best tips on how to address a letter properly</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Most employers would want to have someone who goes the extra mile in achieving their goals. Therefore, it would be best to highlight your other relevant qualifications in your applications for the post of teacher.</p><p class=align-left>If you have any relevant certifications, in addition to your university degree, write about them. Including them will help your cover letter illustrate that you have what it takes to get the job. It is an excellent performance review for you.</p><h2>Avoid being ordinary</h2><p class=align-left>Do not be lazy when creating your application letter for that educational institution where you would like to work. Of course, you can take one of the ready letters and add your name. However, if your potential employer recognises the template you have used, it would be evident to them that you have not applied enough effort to get the position.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1e0b0029d23f5024.png><h2>How to write an application letter for a job of a teacher</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/69a0ff0378e8f61f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write a letter of permission: step by step guide with tips</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You can use an application letter sample to write your own letter but make sure you do not just copy it word for word.
