This is&nbsp;where things get complicated because we&nbsp;love and respect him. However, family members have every right to&nbsp;point out destructive behaviors that affect the household.

That being said perhaps you are also brave enough to approach him now and apologize for hurting his feelings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c18/07a/0fc32655c88d4d0fcd39b1d875.jpg><p>We&nbsp;know that, in&nbsp;similar situations, families usually choose to&nbsp;stay quiet. But instead, this young woman decided to&nbsp;take action to&nbsp;make her father understand that his behavior was hurting their family. This is&nbsp;what other users thought about&nbsp;it:</p><ul><li>He&nbsp;didn’t even realize he&nbsp;was looking in&nbsp;the mirror until the end. Then all the feelings crashed down hard on&nbsp;him. Hopefully, he’ll learn. Good job at&nbsp;figuring out a&nbsp;method that illuminated the situation.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Neither-Entrance-208&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;would believe that he&nbsp;did not know because, in&nbsp;his mind, that is&nbsp;in&nbsp;no&nbsp;way who he&nbsp;is. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rational, calm man who complains only when something is&nbsp;egregiously wrong, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;respected by&nbsp;all and sundry, especially the children. I&nbsp;bet he&nbsp;was thinking, “Haha, my&nbsp;child is&nbsp;rehearsing for a&nbsp;play or&nbsp;some child thing.” Someone whose view of&nbsp;himself is&nbsp;so&nbsp;different from who he&nbsp;really is&nbsp;very well might not realize this when he&nbsp;is&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;his own reflection.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;FeuerroteZora&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I’m a&nbsp;psychologist. Most people are quite blind to&nbsp;how their behavior may appear to&nbsp;and be&nbsp;interpreted by&nbsp;others, at&nbsp;least in&nbsp;some respects. More simply put, we&nbsp;all have blind spots in&nbsp;our self-image, sometimes really big ones, and it’s within these blind spots that many of&nbsp;our less-desirable traits live.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;DrKittyLovah&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;think you have a&nbsp;good chance here. You can acknowledge, “Hey, dad, I&nbsp;know that&nbsp;I probably did hurt your feelings, and I&nbsp;am sorry. Of&nbsp;course, you work hard and provide for&nbsp;us, and we&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I want you to&nbsp;see that your behavior hurts mom’s feelings and hurts the family.” To&nbsp;me, the fact that he&nbsp;went quiet instead of&nbsp;exploding in&nbsp;anger says there is&nbsp;hope!<br>Like many, MANY men his age, he&nbsp;struggles to&nbsp;process those emotions, but he&nbsp;recognized he&nbsp;was feeling more embarrassed/hurt than angry. The key is&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand and withhold judgment, to&nbsp;re-center the convo on&nbsp;not just his pain but everyone’s pain, and to&nbsp;move forward. That’s tough, and you are a&nbsp;kid&nbsp;— it’s not your responsibility to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this. But I&nbsp;always ask, do&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;win or&nbsp;be&nbsp;right? <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Benevelot Ceasar&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;just want to&nbsp;add that&nbsp;I would also recommend you have a&nbsp;private chat with your mother. Explain to&nbsp;her that “me&nbsp;acting like Dad was not just about pointing out his bad behavior toward you. I&nbsp;also wanted to&nbsp;point out how your marriage affects the whole family. The daily fights and Dad’s yelling affects everyone. We&nbsp;all feel it&nbsp;when it&nbsp;gets to&nbsp;the time Dad is&nbsp;due home, and we&nbsp;prepare to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;our dad be&nbsp;mean to&nbsp;our mother. It&nbsp;affects all of&nbsp;us, knowing our dad doesn’t respect our mother.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;excel_pager_420&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>You are awesome. You faced him and did something to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;change the situation. Continue being like this, don’t listen to&nbsp;their complaints about you disrespecting him. Respect is&nbsp;earned, not given away. Moreover, he&nbsp;has been acting like a&nbsp;clown for too long to&nbsp;think he&nbsp;deserves any. Or&nbsp;does he&nbsp;think that he&nbsp;deserves a&nbsp;medal because he&nbsp;brought children into the world and fed them? That is&nbsp;his duty and is&nbsp;really a&nbsp;basic level duty for a&nbsp;parent.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;SkyLightk23&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/547/a9d/5ef88e5eefb7b962ba3bdc0a00.jpg><p>We&nbsp;did some research to&nbsp;see what professionals advise and how we&nbsp;can deal with people who don’t accept their wrongdoings:</p><ul><li><strong>Admitting that one is&nbsp;wrong is&nbsp;extremely difficult: </strong>First, no&nbsp;one is&nbsp;exempt from making mistakes. A&nbsp;person can insist that they’re right, even when they’re not. Likewise, most of&nbsp;those who portray this behavior, also have a&nbsp;fragile ego. They believe that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>if&nbsp;they stand their ground</a> and insist on&nbsp;being right, they can protect themselves from the consequences of&nbsp;their wrongdoings and even change their version of&nbsp;events to&nbsp;escape blame.</li><li><strong>Avoid repeating the fight: </strong>If&nbsp;the person does not accept responsibility for themselves, you need to&nbsp;change the approach or&nbsp;postpone the discussion about the problem. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Insisting</a> will only make them more defensive. Instead of&nbsp;making statements in&nbsp;the second person, it’s better to&nbsp;make them in&nbsp;the first person, for example: “I&nbsp;am embarrassed when we&nbsp;are with my&nbsp;parents and...” instead&nbsp;of: “You are rude to&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents.”</li><li><strong>Presenting the problem as&nbsp;a&nbsp;question:</strong> This can make the other person lower their guard and make them less defensive and more willing to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;logic. Instead of&nbsp;posing a&nbsp;problem like “You’re being rude and disrespectful to&nbsp;Mom!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>change it&nbsp;to</a>&nbsp;“Don’t you think what you said to&nbsp;Mom is&nbsp;rude? How would you feel if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were the other way around?”</li><li><strong>Avoid getting nervous:</strong> It’s challenging to&nbsp;defend one’s views in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;continual opposition. However, by&nbsp;showing that you can control your reactions, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>you are setting a&nbsp;good example</a> for the other person, and they may follow suit.</li><li><strong>Set limits:</strong> When none of&nbsp;the above works, then it’s time to&nbsp;set limits. This means <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>leaving the discussion</a> until the other person is&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;calm and reasonable conversation.</li></ul><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;family, it’s usually not good to&nbsp;fight a&nbsp;lot, especially in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the kids. Surprisingly, some scientists suggest that couples who argue often might actually <a href=#>love each other</a> more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecOam2avkah6trrGq5itnZaquW7DyK2fZqWpYrqwuYyspmahXamutrPHrWShoZ1irm64xKyqqKZdbX16g5ZwZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
