I&nbsp;have always been the <a href=#>saver</a> and&nbsp;he, the spender. At&nbsp;first, it&nbsp;didn’t bother me&nbsp;because we&nbsp;had two incomes. We&nbsp;weren’t rich, but we&nbsp;lived comfortably.</p><p>A&nbsp;few years ago, my&nbsp;husband had a&nbsp;serious car accident, and he&nbsp;can no&nbsp;longer work now, so&nbsp;I became the sole breadwinner. He&nbsp;now receives a&nbsp;disability pension, but the process to&nbsp;get it&nbsp;took four years. During that time, we&nbsp;reduced our savings to&nbsp;zero, we&nbsp;almost lost everything and our debts increased.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d4/168/99946e51689f7d43aacb171550.jpg><p>“When he&nbsp;received the payment he&nbsp;was owed, I&nbsp;only asked him to&nbsp;pay his car loan and to&nbsp;save a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;did neither. Instead, he&nbsp;spent all that money, and&nbsp;I was unable to&nbsp;pay off any of&nbsp;the <a href=#>debts</a> we&nbsp;had accumulated over the years.</p><p>Lately, I&nbsp;have been able to&nbsp;save some money from my&nbsp;salary, but not much, and&nbsp;I plan to&nbsp;pay off some debts once&nbsp;I have enough money saved. He&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I was saving for that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce6/244/e5997f50a29a35eb1b7034ce92.jpg><p>“About a&nbsp;month ago, I&nbsp;noticed that more than $700 was missing from our <a href=#>savings</a>, and&nbsp;I asked him what had happened. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;had lent it&nbsp;to&nbsp;his parents. I&nbsp;asked him when they would pay it&nbsp;back because&nbsp;I needed that money, but he&nbsp;wasn’t sure.</p><p>I&nbsp;lost it&nbsp;at&nbsp;that moment. He&nbsp;never asked&nbsp;me, we&nbsp;hadn’t talked about&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;did it&nbsp;behind my&nbsp;back because he&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I would get angry and would refuse to&nbsp;lend them our money. We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;big fight and&nbsp;I thought he&nbsp;would stop doing things behind my&nbsp;back after that, but he&nbsp;didn’t.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc7/607/f3fc555f16b01e641e3d18b161.jpg><p>“Yesterday I&nbsp;checked my&nbsp;account and another thousand dollars were gone. Where did they&nbsp;go? He&nbsp;gave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>his parents</a>. So, I&nbsp;told him bluntly that from that day onward&nbsp;I would have nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with his side of&nbsp;the family. I’d pay the bills of&nbsp;the house, buy our food and that’s it.</p><p>If&nbsp;he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;lend them all his money, that’s fine, but I’m not going to&nbsp;work 60&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;week so&nbsp;he&nbsp;can keep giving away our money. I&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the bank and withdraw all the money from my&nbsp;account and open a&nbsp;new one that he&nbsp;can’t access. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;taking things too far?”</p><p><h2>How to&nbsp;keep your household finances</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eec/c88/9b0849563786209dc051c1198b.jpg><p>Some simple practices can help to&nbsp;avoid conflict and maintain a&nbsp;harmonious relationship in&nbsp;the management of&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple’s finances. Each of&nbsp;these should be&nbsp;agreed upon in&nbsp;advance by&nbsp;both partners.</p><ul><li><strong>Talk openly about money</strong>: <a href=# title=Communication data-link=tag>Communication</a> is&nbsp;key. Sit down together and talk about your income, expenses, debts, and financial goals. Being honest and transparent will help avoid misunderstandings and build trust.</li><li><strong>Set a&nbsp;budget together</strong>: Creating a&nbsp;budget as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple allows both of&nbsp;you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;clear about how much money is&nbsp;coming in&nbsp;and going out each month. Be&nbsp;involved in&nbsp;this process and decide together how to&nbsp;allocate resources so&nbsp;that you are comfortable with the decisions made.</li><li><strong>Define common financial goals</strong>: Having shared goals, such as&nbsp;saving for a&nbsp;house, a&nbsp;holiday, or&nbsp;your children’s education, can bring you together and give you a&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;team. Celebrating financial achievements together also strengthens the relationship.</li><li><strong>Review finances regularly</strong>: Have regular financial reviews, either monthly or&nbsp;quarterly. This will allow you to&nbsp;adjust <a href=#>the budget</a>, discuss any major changes, and make sure you are both aware of&nbsp;the household’s financial situation.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpnAbq7EnqVmq6Cau6W1zaBkqK2iYsCiwsinnqxlkpq1qrrDZqSyZZKWsKx5wKebZqGdYr22wNOipaBlkWLAtbvPZquoZZmpenl9mG5tcWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
