Several acts from previous AGT seasons will be performing, as well as a few people you might not recognize from Got Talent around the world.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>One notable name in the lineup is <a href=#>V. Unbeatable</a>, the Indian dance group who placed fourth in last year’s competition. They’re back for a second chance at the win. Read on to find out who they’re up against.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Alexa Lauenburger</h3><p>This young dog trainer won Germany’s Got Talent at just 11 years old, and went on to compete on BGT: The Champions last year, where she received the Golden Buzzer from hosts Ant & Dec. We know judge Simon Cowell loves dog acts, but he already <a href=#>used his Golden Buzzer</a> last week, so he can’t give it to Alexa. We’ll have to see what the rest of the judges and the superfans think.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ben Hart</h3><p>This talented magician competed on Britain’s Got Talent last year, and came in third place. He returned for BGT: The Champions, but didn’t make it past the preliminaries. Now he’s taking his unique approach to magic onto the AGT stage. Ben is up against fellow magician Miki Dark this week, so he may not stand out as much.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# class=broken_link>REACTION TO SIMON COWELL’S MOST CONTROVERSIAL GOLDEN BUZZER EVER</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Duo Destiny</h3><p>This hand balancing duo won Poland’s Got Talent in 2018. Now they’re bringing their amazing skills to America. If they make it through to the semifinals, they’ll be up against Duo Transcend, another acrobatic act who made it through thanks to the superfan vote in round one.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOtqbAxRkyM</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Freckled Sky</h3><p>This video projection dance group reached the quarterfinals of AGT Season 10. They only had two dancers then, but for AGT: The Champions, they have two new members. Val Syganevich is the mind behind the group’s creative performances. Will it impress the judges or superfans enough to send them through?</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# class=broken_link>‘AGT: CHAMPIONS ACT GONE HORRIBLY WRONG [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Grimm</h3><p>This singer won Season 5 of AGT with his impressive voice and chill style. He’s since released several albums and toured with Stevie Nicks. Will his talent be enough to put him through to the semifinals? As the only singer in this round, he might just stand out in AGT: Champions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Miki Dark</h3><p>This scary magician and danger act reached the semifinals on Holland’s Got Talent last year. His white face makeup and menacing stage persona, not to mention his dangerous illusion, frightened the judges. He’s up against fellow magician Ben Hart, albeit with a very different style.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49wGNz_2wbI</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Moses Concas</h3><p>Moses is a beatboxer and harmonica player who won Italy’s Got Talent in 2016. He has a sound all his own, but will it be enough to make it to the next round? Considering he’s up against fellow musician Tyler Butler-Figueroa, Moses might be at a disadvantage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Quick Style</h3><p>This hip-hop dance group won Norway’s Got Talent in 2009, and also competed on World of Dance in the United States. They’ve definitely got talent, but will they be able to compete against fan favorite dance group V. Unbeatable? We’ll have to wait and see AGT: Champions on Monday.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmFukQHrmmk</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Tyler Butler-Figueroa</h3><p>This young violinist inspired the judges and audience last season on AGT with his story of surviving cancer and being bullied. He reached the Top 10, but this time he’s back and hoping to win it all. He’s definitely a beloved act, which might mean the superfans vote him through.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>V. Unbeatable</h3><p>This is the act we’ve all been waiting for, right? We were shocked when this talented acrobatic dance group only made it to fourth place last season on AGT. They’re back to prove themselves, and we’ll be amazed if they don’t at least make it to the semifinals on AGT: Champions.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-11-1.jpeg alt="WATCH ‘AGT’ Winner Michael Grimm Make An Emotional Return For ‘Champions’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>america's got talent: the champions</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmrGWgmr%2Bnu9GmoKefXaS7bq3GrWStoJVisKmtzKmgqKajYsSmscpmamg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
