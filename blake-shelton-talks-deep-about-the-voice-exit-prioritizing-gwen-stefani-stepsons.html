Amid looming exit, Shelton opens about lifestyle change after marrying Gwen Stefani and playing stepparent to her kids.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-shelton-accounts-his-rise-to-fame-to-the-voice>Blake Shelton Accounts His Rise to Fame to The Voice</h2><p>Throughout his 12 fruitful years in The Voice, Shelton gradually cemented his inimitable reputation both in television and in the country music arena. In his interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>, Shelton admitted that his approaching exit in The Voice was a bittersweet decision.</p><p>“I never really made it to the A-level of country artists until I became a coach,” he said. “The show did a hell of a lot more for me than I brought to the table at the time. I’ve far exceeded anything I thought I could ever accomplish in the entertainment world.”</p><p>During the pandemic, Shelton has already laid out his retirement plans. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barmageddon</a>, a game show he created with close friend Carson Daly, had just premiered last December 5.</p><p>Aside from Barmageddon, Shelton looks forward to bonding more with his family. Evidently, the country star is becoming more intentional with his time by wanting to focus on his farm in Oklahoma and spending chill dates with his wife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Wants to Prioritize Family with Stefani and Stepsons This Time</h2><p>After marrying Stefani, Shelton assumed the role of being a stepfather to her three sons, Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo. Admittedly, raising kids wasn’t on top of his bucket list, but he’s taking the job more seriously than ever. In fact, such is a major reason for his retirement in The Voice.</p><p>“You don’t know what your regrets are going to be until you look back one day. I feel like my regrets would be, if I stayed on this path, that I am missing out on some more important things in life — and for now, that’s our kids,” he said.</p><p>According to the country star, he’s already made “plenty of money” for years. Now, his target investment would be more memories with Stefani and his three stepsons.</p><p>The Voice has undeniably given Shelton an extended family, but he honestly confessed that his best moments remain when he’s back home in Oklahoma. Thus, even though leaving the show is a tough move, such is an inevitable choice for the “No Body” singer.</p><p>At the moment, <a href=#>Team</a><a href=#>Blake</a> is leading in The Voice, sending three of his artists in the Finale. The Voice Season 22 will return next week, with America ultimately deciding who the winner will be.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/JennyMcCarthy_DonnieWahlburg-220x165.jpg alt="Jenny McCarthy Literally Goes Nude For New Beauty Brand Campaign" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWaskaG4tHnDnpypZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWmpLaksYyer6KsXaW%2FqrvRoquispmjtG6z1p6lZqukmrOiushmqq2doKi8r7%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
