But how many second hand shoppers in Britain consider environmental reasons to be their biggest motivator?</p><p>Whilst 63% of Britons say they have bought clothes second hand, half of these people (52%) say that second hand items comprise only 1-10% of their wardrobe. In fact, just one in five of those who have ever bought second hand clothes (21%) say more than 30% of their wardrobe is sourced second hand, implying fast fashion still dominates.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/kate_clothes_second_hand.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The main reason given for shopping second hand is to save money, which is a motivation for 67% of those who have ever bought second hand clothes. The next most common reason, at 40%, is to support charities, meaning that environmental reasons are only the third most popular reason, at just 27%. Another 22% of second hand clothes shoppers do so because it allows them to get clothes in their preferred style, while 14% say it is for ethical reasons (such as concern about labour practices).</p><p>Although environmental reasons are not the leading reason why shoppers buy second hand, it is a much greater motivation among younger Britons. Half (47%) of 18-24yr olds who shop second hand say they do so for environmental reasons, compared to just 27% of 25-49yr olds, 25% of 50-64yr olds and 18% of 65+yr olds.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/kate_clothes_second_hand_motivations.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Additionally, people are far more likely to list the environment as a reason if a bigger proportion of their clothes are second hand. Half (47%) of those whose wardrobe is made up of more than 30% second hand clothes say environmental reasons have motivated them, twice as many as those of those who purchased 30% or less of their clothes second hand (22%). Regular second hand shoppers are more likely to list many reasons, however, so are also more likely to list both price (83%) and to support charities (48%).</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhraWWDdHnOp6OyZaGqrrPAxKtkrJ2TpLuleceapZ1lk6G8tbTErGSsoJ%2Blvaa%2B0mabqGWjpHqmug%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
