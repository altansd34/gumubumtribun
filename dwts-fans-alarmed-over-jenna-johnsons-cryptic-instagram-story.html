This immediately led fans into thinking that something wrong might have happened regarding her pregnancy.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jenna-johnson-got-fans-worried-over-vague-instagram-story>Jenna Johnson Got Fans Worried Over Vague Instagram Story</h2><p>In a now-deleted story on Instagram, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnson</a> took the time to address her inactivity on social media. According to her, she wasn‚Äôt in the right emotional state to interact with her followers lately.</p><p>‚ÄúBeen MIA for the past week. Haven‚Äôt had the mental/emotional capacity to be on here or engage,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúBut wanted to check in and say hello and thank you for those who have reached out. Will share more a little later on.‚Äù</p><p>One fan was able to take a screenshot of her story, immediately uploading it on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>Reddit</a>. There, fans expressed their assumptions about the cryptic update. Apparently, most fans thought that Johnson could be enduring a pregnancy complication.</p><p>‚ÄúI just saw this and ran here to see if anyone else had seen. This doesn‚Äôt sound good üôÅ I really hope everything with the baby is okay,‚Äù one user wrote.</p><p>Several others replied in the discussion thread, wishing Johnson and her baby well. Meanwhile, some believe that the bad news might be anything unrelated to her pregnancy, saying that her husband <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Val Chmerkovskiy</a> doesn‚Äôt show any bad signs on his social media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Reveals Death of Her Little Niece</h2><p>A day after her cryptic story, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro has finally broken silence about her real situation. In an Instagram post, Johnson revealed that her family had lost a baby, that being her niece.</p><p>‚ÄúMy angel little brother and sweet sister in law went through the unimaginable as they lost their baby girl this last week,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in awe at their examples of hope and immeasurable strength during this heart wrenching time.‚Äù</p><p>Understandably, Johnson was mourning alongside her relatives throughout her quick hiatus online. Reflecting on their tragic lost, she was still grateful that their family gathered together to pay tribute to her brother‚Äôs baby.</p><p>Amid the difficult time, Johnson hopes that fans would send love and prayers to her niece‚Äôs parents, Skyler and Ashton.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The-Voice-Kelly-Clarkson-Girl-Named-Tom-220x147.png alt="Kelly Clarkson, Girl Named Tom Among ‚ÄòThe Voice‚Äô Season 22 Finale Performers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWWlru0ecClmKullZl6sMLEq2SjnZ6jrm62zqGlrKeeqHqkvtipq6KbXZ67tMDAoKmapV2owbC%2B2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
