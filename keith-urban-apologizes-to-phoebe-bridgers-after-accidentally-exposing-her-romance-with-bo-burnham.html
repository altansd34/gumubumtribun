Bridgers and Burnham have been under-the-radar since January.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Keith Urban Reacts to Unintentionally Revealing Phoebe Bridgers, Bo Burnham’s Relationship</h2><p>Urban is now aware that he has to be careful of when he takes videos to upload on TikTok. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight during Day 2 of CMA Fest 2023, the country crooner reflected on the unintended moment.</p><p>“Yeah, oh, I found out,” he said. “Phoebe, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Urban and his wife Nicole Kidman were present at the Philadelphia leg of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a>‘s Eras Tour last month. Filming their concert experience, the couple shared to TikTok a clip from the show where they were singing to Swift’s 1989 hit “Style.” Apparently, hawk-eyed fans immediately noticed a possible romantic pair in the background, catching Bridgers and Burnham sharing an intimate kiss behind Urvan and Kidman.</p><p>“It felt very awkward,” he said. “I felt bad. I was just digging on the concert! You never know what’s gonna happen.”</p><p>After being photographed in Los Angeles, California early this year, fans have been speculating that love is brewing between Bridgers and Burnham. The two, however, neither confirmed nor denied the assumptions. They also haven’t responded to Urban after his statement.</p><a title=@keithurban href=# rel=noopener>@keithurban</a> we love ya @Taylor Swift 🫶 <a title=erastour href=# rel=noopener>#erastour</a> <a title="♬ Style" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Style</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-says-taylor-swift-is-among-the-greatest-songwriters>He Says Taylor Swift is Among The Greatest Songwriters</h2><p>Regarding his experience during the concert, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Urban</a> stated that he had a “blast” having his wife around.

Subsequently, the singer teased what fans can expect from his string of shows.</p><p>“We’re looking to maybe slip in some songs we’ve never done before,” he said.</p><p>The singer also shared that they might perform “one or two” of his newest songs.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_LionelRichie_LukeBryan_KatyPerry_ABC_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="Luke Bryan Defends Fellow Judge Katy Perry Against ‘American Idol’ Backlash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6graBdqr%2Bjrc1mmKmnnKS0qsbErGStp12ltbCxwZ5km6qZmbSmvtJmmJ%2Bslad6oq%2FCopuepqSWua3FjJ6vqaejnruoeceeqWaqn6Kur6%2FEZq6irJhir7B5wa6pp6CRonw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
