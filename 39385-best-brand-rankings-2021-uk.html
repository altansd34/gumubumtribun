The Index Improvers chart ranks the brands with the highest increase in Index, comparing scores from the previous 12-month period. To be included in the improver list, the variance must be positive. Both scores are representative of the general population of adults 18+ (some are online representative).</p><p>All Index scores listed have been rounded to a single decimal place; however, we have used additional precision to assign ranks. All brands have been tracked for at least 6 months to be included in the rankings and have been tracked for at least 18 months to appear in the Improvers tables.</p><p>For this year’s global list, YouGov used data from 54 markets – data from markets that cover three sectors or fewer were not counted in the top 10. The rankings use the Index score which assesses overall brand health. It takes into account perceptions of a brand’s reputation and whether consumers would recommend the brand to others, as well as whether it represents good value and quality.</p><p><strong>About YouGov</strong></p><p>YouGov is an international research and data analytics group.</p><p>Our mission is to supply a continuous stream of accurate data into what the world thinks, so that organisations can better serve the communities that sustain them.</p><p>Each day, our highly engaged proprietary global panel of over 15 million members provides us with thousands of data points on consumer opinions, attitudes and behaviour.
