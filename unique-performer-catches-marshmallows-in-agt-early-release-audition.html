His performance involved catching marshmallows in his mouth.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-performer-catches-marshmallows-in-agt-early-release>Performer Catches Marshmallows in AGT Early Release</h2><p>Shayne started his performance by catching a marshmallow thrown from the theater’s balcony. He spat it out instead of chewing it, so he could quickly catch the next one. He then recruited host Terry Crews to throw marshmallows toward him, which he caught.</p><p>Eventually, Shayne asked the judges to try throwing marshmallows from the table. Those thrown by Heidi Klum and Howie Mandel were the first ones Shayne failed to catch — but that wasn’t really his fault. Finally, Simon Cowell tried his hand at it, and Shayne was successful.</p><p>After his audition, judge Sofia Vergara asked Shayne how he discovered that he could do this, and he responded, “Hibachi grill when I was, like, 12.” That answer made the audience laugh.</p><p>“What I loved about this was we just weren’t expecting this,” Cowell told Shayne. Vergara called the talent “useless,” but she still voted “yes” to sending Shayne through. He ended up with four “yes” votes from the judges to move on.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">13-YEAR-OLD SINGER IMPRESSES WITH BILLIE EILISH COVER IN ‘AGT’ EARLY RELEASE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-season-19-is-still-in-the-audition-stage>Season 19 Is Still in the Audition Stage</h2><p>America’s Got Talent Season 19 is still in the audition stage, with Tuesday’s new episode marking the seventh week of the competition. There will be eight weeks of auditions before the season takes a break to make room for the Summer Olympics on NBC.</p><p>This season, the judges each have two Golden Buzzers. So far, Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, and Howie Mandel have all hit both of their Golden Buzzers, while host Terry Crews has hit his own. That means we’re still waiting for Sofia Vergara to hit her second Golden Buzzer. There also might be a group Golden Buzzer at some point.</p><p>Live shows for Season 19 are scheduled to begin on August 13. Performances will air on Tuesday nights, with results shows on the following Wednesday. Are you excited to watch the rest of the season?
