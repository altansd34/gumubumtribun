We will have to sweat a lot. It is simply impossible to do this without special exercises. But even with their help, you will not have an immediate result. It will take at least 6-8 months. And during this time, you can only pump up the butty a little, growing its volume by 3-5 cm.</p><p class=align-left>But today we will not talk about how to increase the volume of the buttocks through exercise, we will tell you about some tricks that will visually make your buttocks bigger.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e5084ac5b12752fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Stanbic IBTC Pension: Every ‘Someday’ needs a plan</span></p></a><h3>1. Change your walk</h3><p class=align-left>The way you are walking can emphasize or veil various parts of the body. Just straighten your shoulders and arch your lower back. It will not only make your butty more attractive but will make your waist slimmer and visually enlarge your chests.</p><p class=align-left>Imitate «Cat Walk.» Imagine that on the ground in front of you is drawn a straight line that runs exactly under the navel, in the center between the feet. When you take a step, move the foot towards the center of the body, that is, place it on this imaginary line. Then stand on the same line with your second stop, just before the first one. Keep going this way - one foot in front of the other - and squeeze the buttocks.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Botcho cream before and after: does it really work?</p><h3>2. Pick the right jeans</h3><p class=align-left>A well-matched pair of jeans can visually change your butty. It becomes round and raised. The next time when you will choose jeans, remember the following:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b524fb8024e3fad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rapper Kanye West to give back his music artistes 50% of their masters</span></p></a><ul><li><strong>Jeans should sit tight.</strong> Baggy trousers "drown" your curves, so, they cannot be seen under the excess fabric. Skinny jeans or stretchy ones are perfect for showing off your buttocks. If you are not very comfortable in them, pick up jeans that just sit well in the back.</li><li><strong>Pay attention to the location of the pockets. </strong>Small high pockets on the butty will visually enlarge it. Besides, pockets with decorations such as sparkles, seams or colored threads, create interest and attract the eye to your butty. Do not wear jeans with too big pockets or no pockets at all.</li><li><strong>Try jeans with high waist.</strong> The top of jeans should fit your waist in the narrowest place so that it will look thin, and the butty will seem bigger.</li><li><strong>Jeans with a low waist</strong> (sitting on the hips in the widest part) with a close-fitting shirt also visually increase the size of the buttocks.</li><li><strong>Do not wear dark jeans</strong> in which the buttocks and legs will look smaller (especially if you are wearing a light top). Instead, try white, pastel or light blue jeans.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d306f8c4c7bd5bd3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I hate cheap gifts - Actress Sylvia Oluchy says, gives reasons</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e5084ac5b12752fa.jpg><h3>3. Tighten the waist</h3><p class=align-left>If you emphasize a waist, your butty will look more proportionally. Whether your belly is small or not, try these tips to make a favorable impression for men:</p><ul><li><strong>Wear a belt at the waist.</strong> Find a narrow or wide belt and tie it at the waist in the narrowest place, over a blouse or shirt (the belt looks best over button-down shirts, sweaters or loose blouses). Choose a dark belt over a light shirt for excellent effect.</li><li><strong>Try a belt corset.</strong> If your waist is slightly larger than you would like, try wearing a corset belt. It must shift the excess from the abdomen to the buttocks and hips. Corset can be purchased at most clothing and underwear stores.</li><li><strong>Do not wear anything in a horizontal strip or with patterns on the waist.</strong> Overloaded with an ornament or too bright fabric emphasizes your belly and visually increases it. Instead, stop at the dark base colours on top. So your butty will look big and hot!</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9da79168c0c6d0d4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>We are not hiding again - Rapper Ikechukwu says as he finally shows off girlfriend (photo)</span></p></a><h3>4. Put on high heels</h3><p class=align-left>They change the natural shape of the spine in such a way that both the butty and the chest are more visible.</p><p class=align-left>If you want to make the buttocks bigger, forget about the low thin heel for the spike heels.</p><p class=align-left>If you are not sure that it will work, stand on tiptoe in front of the mirror. Take a few steps, and you will notice how the movements of your legs and backside slightly become bigger. Your legs will look slimmer, and the butty will be visually a couple of centimeters higher.</p><h3>5. Buy special corrective underwear or sides</h3><p class=align-left>Try modeling underwear, which immediately makes the butty bigger without sides or buy special pads designed to add the volume to the hips visually when you are wearing jeans or trousers. These are effective tools that will instantly make your buttocks more attractive. Choose the size that best suits your clothing and the image you want to achieve.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/353c71ddc73373ab.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lifestyle: 8 superb clothing hacks that'll change your life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Some jeans are even originally sold with stitched sides.</p><p class=align-left>Try to make the sides by your own hands, using foam filler or material for stuffing pillows and blankets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b524fb8024e3fad.jpg><h3>6. Be careful with the surgical procedures for buttocks enlargement</h3><p class=align-left>Various fillers, injections, and implants have recently enjoyed considerable popularity, but the results are rather contradictory. In some cases, after such procedures, the buttocks looked very uneven, the filler material eventually crawled and moved. In the worst cases, procedures to make the butty bigger caused serious health problems.</p><p class=align-left>Some people even died as a result of toxic injections or improper installation of implants. Before you decide on such an operation, it is important to know and be aware of all the potential consequences of such a decision.</p><h2>What to eat to get a bigger buttocks fast</h2><p class=align-left>If you want to make your butty bigger, you should abandon a strict diet aimed at decreasing body weight. The body spends the received calories to maintain the work of the organism if there is a shortage of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ba471ea66eb848f3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>AMVERIFIED: Africa’s indigenous social network community</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The process of increasing the buttocks also does not occur when eating sweets or fatty foods.
