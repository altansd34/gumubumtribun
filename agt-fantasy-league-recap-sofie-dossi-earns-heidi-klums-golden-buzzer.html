During the show, judge Heidi Klum hit the Golden Buzzer for her own act, contortionist Sofie Dossi.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofie-dossi-earns-golden-buzzer-on-agt-fantasy-league>Sofie Dossi Earns Golden Buzzer on AGT: Fantasy League</h2><p>During Monday’s show, it was Heidi Klum’s turn to hit the Golden Buzzer. This season, judges can choose to hit the Golden Buzzer to send one of their own acts to the Finals, or to steal an act from another judge’s team (also sending the act to the Finals).</p><p>Contortionist Sofie Dossi, who first appeared on AGT Season 11 and later returned for AGT: The Champions, took the stage during Monday’s show to perform a gravity-defying routine. She started by hanging from the ceiling on a flaming hoop before showing off some impressive balancing skills.</p><p>Sofie ended her performance by shooting a flaming arrow with her feet, popping two balloons. The judges were wowed, giving Sofie a standing ovation. Howie Mandel said he would use the Golden Buzzer on her if he could. Instead, Klum ended up hitting it for her. Sofie will go to the Finals and stay on Klum’s team.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">THE PACK DRUMLINE BLOWS THE ROOF OFF IN ‘AGT: FANTASY LEAGUE’ EARLY RELEASE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-heidi-klum-send-acts-to-the-semifinals>Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum Send Acts to the Semifinals</h3><p>At the end of Monday’s show, host Terry Crews announced which acts earned enough votes from the audience to move on to the Semifinals. The five acts going through were all on either Simon Cowell or Heidi Klum’s teams.</p><p>That includes magician Yu Hojin, who made it to the finals of AGT Season 17. He competed on Klum’s team with a routine in which he made paper airplanes appear out of thin air and even made them hover in midair. The judges gave him a standing ovation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cowell had three acts move on to the Semifinals — BGT singer Loren Allred, AGT Season 17 group The Pack Drumline, and country trio Chapel Hart. On Klum’s team, Mongolia’s Got Talent winner Enkh-Erdene also went through.</p><p>The singer shocked everyone when he performed “Friends in Low Places” by Garth Brooks, showing off a deep voice that would fit right in on country radio. He’ll move on to the Semifinals to perform for a chance to compete in the finale.</p><p>What did you think of this week’s episode? Do you agree with the results?
