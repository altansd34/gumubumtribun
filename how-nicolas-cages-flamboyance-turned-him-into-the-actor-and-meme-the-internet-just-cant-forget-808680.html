Considered a&nbsp;bad actor to&nbsp;some and a&nbsp;good actor to&nbsp;others, what’s really important is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;has earned a&nbsp;special place in&nbsp;the hearts of&nbsp;all of&nbsp;us. Not only for having starred in&nbsp;some classics of&nbsp;decades past but also because, even if&nbsp;you haven’t seen his <a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>, you’ve most likely seen him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;meme.</p><p>Today <strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;present a&nbsp;brief summary of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> of&nbsp;the legendary actor Nicolas Cage and we&nbsp;chose the best memes to&nbsp;illustrate our piece. Have a&nbsp;look!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60a/510/8340725221970f5702cd90eddc.jpg><p>LYDIE / SIPA / EAST NEWS</p><p>Nicolas Kim Coppola, born into the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Coppola</a> family, changed his stage name to&nbsp;Nicolas Cage early in&nbsp;his career to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> on&nbsp;his own merit. Although three of&nbsp;his first films were directed by&nbsp;his uncle, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Francis Ford Coppola</a>, this was only the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;very extensive career.</p><p>Part of&nbsp;his success is&nbsp;due to&nbsp;his peculiar acting technique. Thanks to&nbsp;that, most people can remember his face so&nbsp;easily. We&nbsp;are referring to&nbsp;an&nbsp;acting style that, although it&nbsp;could come across as&nbsp;“exaggerated” for many, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;experimenting with modern <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressionism</a>. Cage’s acting really made some movies brilliant. That came with unforgettable memes like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Vampire’s Kiss</i></a>, where Cage’s character is&nbsp;descending into madness after believing a&nbsp;vampire woman kissed him. “Think of&nbsp;the stars of&nbsp;silent films, of&nbsp;German expressionism. I&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;abstract. Naturalism is&nbsp;a&nbsp;style, and&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more expressionistic,” the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/12a/40f/9664c65748811b8a7b92898b45.jpg><p>The first stage of&nbsp;Cage’s career, which was plagued by&nbsp;experimentation, featured films such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Valley Girl</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Moonstruck</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wild at&nbsp;Heart</i></a>. Here Nicolas would go&nbsp;on&nbsp;to&nbsp;perfect this technique and learn to&nbsp;choose in&nbsp;which movies it&nbsp;was convenient to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it. The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a> that when he&nbsp;ventures into new acting styles, his characters “have problems, whether it’s a&nbsp;mental illness, an&nbsp;addiction or&nbsp;whatever. There’s an&nbsp;organic engine that drives that behavior, and that’s why&nbsp;I made the decision to&nbsp;apply myself and experiment.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33c/7e3/7923a159889fdf4d96b9419da9.jpg><p>Little by&nbsp;little, Nicolas would land more critical roles that would launch him to&nbsp;fame. At&nbsp;this stage, Nicolas starred in&nbsp;tremendous box office hits such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Con Air</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Face/Off</i></a>, or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Rock</i></a>. These films also gave&nbsp;us viral memes that made him famous, even among people who had not seen his movies.</p><p>This, however, did not mean that Nicolas could not become known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;prestigious actor because at&nbsp;this stage, he&nbsp;received an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Oscar data-link=tag>Oscar</a> award for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Leaving Las Vegas</i></a> and was nominated for another one for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Adaptation</i></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/661/074/ddc9f75203b223d36cbec5bd71.jpg><p>Everything seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;going well for the talented actor. However, some personal and financial <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>problems</a> caused the actor to&nbsp;be&nbsp;slowly forgotten by&nbsp;the public.</p><p>His decline resulted from factors such as&nbsp;using his signature technique at&nbsp;the wrong time and taking part in&nbsp;films that the critics did not very well receive. During this time, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Wicker Man</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ghost Rider</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Sorcerer’s Apprentice</i></a>, or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Next</i></a>. However, had it&nbsp;not been for this last stage of&nbsp;his career, we&nbsp;would not have been “blessed” with memes such as&nbsp;the famous “Your argument is&nbsp;invalid” and others.</p><p>By&nbsp;this point, the actor has become one of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Internet data-link=tag>Internet</a>’s favorite faces. The euphoria for Cage is&nbsp;such that anything can become a&nbsp;meme, as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;it&nbsp;has his face on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Probably one of&nbsp;the reasons why the actor’s face is&nbsp;so&nbsp;well received by&nbsp;internet memers is&nbsp;the fact that he’s not just eccentric on&nbsp;screen. Cage is&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;character even when he’s away from the cameras. For example, the actor named his son “Kal-El” after the&nbsp;DC comic book <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>character</a>. He&nbsp;also has a&nbsp;rare obsession with exotic animals. He&nbsp;has octopuses, cobras, and sharks, and even sleeps with his crocodiles. His fascination with strange animals also led him to&nbsp;buy, through auction, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tarbosaurus fossil</a>, although he&nbsp;has not been able to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;due to&nbsp;legal issues.</p><p>Another proof of&nbsp;his eccentricity lies in&nbsp;his interest in&nbsp;haunted properties. Cage has bought several haunted mansions and has even acquired a&nbsp;sarcophagus. He&nbsp;already drew <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>specifications</a> on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;handle his body for his eternal rest.</p><p>Fortunately for the actor and his fans, everything seems to&nbsp;point to&nbsp;the fact that his career is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;change course, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;preparing for a&nbsp;triumphant resurgence. In&nbsp;recent years, he&nbsp;has appeared in&nbsp;films for which he&nbsp;has again been critically acclaimed. Think of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Mom and Dad</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Mandy</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Pig</i></a>, or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Unbearable Weight of&nbsp;Massive Talent</i></a>, where he&nbsp;will have the opportunity to&nbsp;play himself and take a&nbsp;nostalgic journey through his most iconic performances and where he&nbsp;once again will prove why he&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;Oscar winner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/41e/b0f/6d716a5715b4908bfbf59c4ef6.jpg><p>How would you react if&nbsp;you were turned into a&nbsp;meme?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ynoJynnJbAbq%2FAoJysZZahrq6uzrKYp5uVYsG2vs2em2agmaJ6qrrTqGStoJVirqTAzqtkmqaUYrqmucRmq6GdXZ67tbHRp5ytZZqqwLV5wpqlrWWWpL%2BosdNmb2lwZm19cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
