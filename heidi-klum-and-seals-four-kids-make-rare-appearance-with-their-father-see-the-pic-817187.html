Making a&nbsp;rare public appearance, the 60-year-old singer was accompanied by&nbsp;kids, with his teenage sons notably standing out as&nbsp;they nearly matched or&nbsp;even surpassed their famous father in&nbsp;height.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/936/606/eadac7514bb77c8677245e15d3.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Posing</a> elegantly outside the Academy Museum, Seal exuded pride alongside his daughters Lou, 13, and Leni, 19, and his sons, Johan, 16, and the 18-year-old Henry, who already matches his father’s impressive height at&nbsp;6’3.</p><p>Seal, accompanied by&nbsp;his longtime partner Laura Strayer, radiated joy while confidently standing with his children. The entire family effortlessly showcased their impeccable style, creating a&nbsp;captivating presence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/718/199/4039285540bca9bf652f087f8b.jpg><p>Seal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adopted</a> the eldest, Leni, during their relationship with Heidi Klum. Their paths crossed in&nbsp;2005, just as&nbsp;Klum was expecting her strikingly similar-looking daughter. Despite their eventual split in&nbsp;2012, this significant event remains a&nbsp;transformative chapter in&nbsp;Seal’s life as&nbsp;it&nbsp;“changed [his] life for the better...”.</p><p>Seal has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> his thoughts on&nbsp;his adopted daughter’s blossoming modelling career: “I’m so&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;everything that Leni has done. But I’m more proud of&nbsp;everything that she&nbsp;is. She walks through life with this type of&nbsp;humility that allows her to&nbsp;move so&nbsp;gracefully through it&nbsp;all and she has an&nbsp;innate understanding of&nbsp;people in&nbsp;general and people’s feelings. So&nbsp;I’m kind of&nbsp;more impressed with everything that she&nbsp;is.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4f8/467/a50890513ea333562b5fb2caa4.jpg><p>As&nbsp;of&nbsp;today, Heidi Klum is&nbsp;married to&nbsp;her husband Tom Kaulitz, with the couple tying the <a href=#>knot</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;private ceremony in&nbsp;February 2019.
