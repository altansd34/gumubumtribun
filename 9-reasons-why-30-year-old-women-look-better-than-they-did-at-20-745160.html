They are just as&nbsp;beautiful and young. And it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not just about the appearance, but it’s also about their behavior, their voice, and their body language. Women with a&nbsp;10-year age difference look as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they are from the same generation. Maybe it’s because they really are?</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> wondered what 20-year-olds and 30-year-olds have in&nbsp;common and why older women often look better than when they were young.</p><p><h2>They don’t care about age or&nbsp;other things as&nbsp;much.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/28e/bc6/d598dd55d79baf9b4ddebaac57.jpg><p>As&nbsp;strange as&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems, age actually helps&nbsp;us to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more relaxed about many things, including the age itself and public opinion. 30-year-old people are more <a href=#>confident</a> and are less worried about what people think of&nbsp;them. This makes them more interesting and attractive people.</p><p><h2>They follow the fashion trends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e33/b5a/c678bc55e7b56d348b5eeb1a51.jpg><p>Very often, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;really hard to&nbsp;tell a&nbsp;20-year old woman from a&nbsp;30-year old: modern women follow the same makeup and clothing trends. At&nbsp;20&nbsp;or 30, they can use the same makeup, wear the same jeans, T-shirts, and whatever is&nbsp;trendy that season.</p><p><h2>They can afford expensive things and services.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60c/3e9/592d3750b68008153cfa81193a.jpg><p>By&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;30, most people already understand what they want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;in&nbsp;their lives, and they have some business reputation. And even if&nbsp;they don’t, they have some experience which is&nbsp;extremely valuable. Having more money than just what they make from a&nbsp;scholarship or&nbsp;a&nbsp;part-time job allows them to&nbsp;spend it&nbsp;on&nbsp;themselves: buying expensive clothes, and visiting beauty salons and cosmetologists.</p><p><h2>They have found their style and they keep looking.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bbe/8a4/7db44b501a84968fbb116e7fcd.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, 30&nbsp;years old is&nbsp;the golden age in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;image. By&nbsp;this time, a&nbsp;woman already has everything: she understands what suits her and what doesn’t, she has the courage to&nbsp;experiment with her appearance, and she has the money to&nbsp;experiment with experts and use only the most high-quality materials.</p><p><h2>They know what they want.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b3/3a1/53312552cdb9d9d872aa1071c5.jpg><p>People in&nbsp;their 20s have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;interests and hobbies, are looking for their professional path, and fall in&nbsp;love chaotically. When they are&nbsp;30, they have a&nbsp;much better understanding of&nbsp;what they want from their lives, and they do&nbsp;everything they can to&nbsp;reach their goals. And self-confidence is&nbsp;always attractive.</p><p><h2>They’ve overcome their insecurities.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/335/5d4/302654577ba6b7a4b3098897ca.jpg><p>Or&nbsp;they just <a href=#>learned</a> how to&nbsp;live with them. Every person has their own insecurities to&nbsp;deal with: stereotypes about themselves, self-doubt, nervous breakdowns. When a&nbsp;person just starts living on&nbsp;their own, their background may let them down at&nbsp;pretty much any point. But by&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;30, they have either dealt with their problems or&nbsp;have learned to&nbsp;live with them, which makes any woman more attractive.</p><p><h2 class=adme-img-description>They stopped eating bad food.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c87/b78/38156c59fc98c88cfebd5d94d8.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, we&nbsp;can’t say that 30-year-olds don’t eat fast food at&nbsp;all, but they definitely try to&nbsp;reduce the amount and improve the overall quality of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=diets data-link=tag>diets</a>. Older women think about what they eat, and they cook more often than younger girls. This approach has a&nbsp;positive effect on&nbsp;their skin, their mood, and their overall look.</p><p><h2>They realize that they won’t be&nbsp;young forever.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b10/8c5/13dcca596799331ad7cfd6dc8e.jpg><p>When a&nbsp;woman is&nbsp;20&nbsp;years old, she feels like she will always look this way: her body will be&nbsp;strong and <a href=# title=healthy data-link=tag>healthy</a>, her skin will be&nbsp;toned. This is&nbsp;why 20-year-olds have the time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;nothing for a&nbsp;year or&nbsp;2. But when you are&nbsp;30, you realize that the future is&nbsp;closer than it&nbsp;seems and that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;time to&nbsp;start taking care of&nbsp;your body and mind. 30-year-old women are more <a href=#>determined</a> to&nbsp;stay healthy and young and this attracts a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people.</p><p>The most important thing to&nbsp;remember is&nbsp;that any age has its advantages, and we&nbsp;just need to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;enjoy them. What are the advantages of&nbsp;your age?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in July 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuvsSaqqimo2LEqcWMbGdmsZWWv267y51ksKedmrtuuM6oomaalanBpr6MrZ%2Bapl2ptabFjJ2gnWWRqXpzfIxwa25pZmV8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
