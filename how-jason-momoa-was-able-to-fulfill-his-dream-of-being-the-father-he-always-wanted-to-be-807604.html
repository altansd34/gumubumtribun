But beyond acting, he&nbsp;always had the dream of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;father and starting a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. Although he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through certain difficulties to&nbsp;get there, the first of&nbsp;them was being raised by&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother. He&nbsp;always felt he&nbsp;lacked a&nbsp;father figure to&nbsp;achieve his purpose in&nbsp;life.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> looked into Jason Momoa’s past and how his biggest role models helped him become the best father he&nbsp;can&nbsp;be.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jason Momoa</a>’s full name is&nbsp;Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa, and he&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;Hawaii in&nbsp;1979. His father, Joseph Namakaeha, is&nbsp;Hawaiian and a&nbsp;painter, while his mother, Coni Momoa, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;photographer. When he&nbsp;was 6&nbsp;months old, his mother took him to&nbsp;Norwalk to&nbsp;be&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;her family.</p><p>Jason Momoa was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>raised</a> by&nbsp;his mother from a&nbsp;very young age, as&nbsp;she had divorced his father and returned to&nbsp;her hometown. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;12, he&nbsp;learned that he&nbsp;had Hawaiian ancestry on&nbsp;his father’s side, and began visiting him during the summers to&nbsp;learn more about his culture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dac/078/dff96d5b23a467d62f87e3c73b.jpg><p>Although he&nbsp;felt a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;affection for his parents, the actor also felt he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lacked</a> something because his father wasn’t there with his mother: “My&nbsp;cousins were very lucky. I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;little jealous of&nbsp;them because&nbsp;I didn’t have a&nbsp;father, and that’s why&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one myself,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>When he&nbsp;had children with Lisa Bonet, he&nbsp;felt great joy, since his dream came true. He&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;give himself the opportunity to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the father.</p><p>Because his father figure was almost non-existent during his childhood, the actor suffered from many insecurities when his children were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a>: “I&nbsp;didn’t know what it&nbsp;takes to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;father. I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;just tell my&nbsp;son, ’Because I&nbsp;said so.’ I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;connect, and&nbsp;I really want him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;vulnerable and open.”</p><p>Although he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the hit series <i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i>, this was not enough to&nbsp;get his acting career off the ground, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>went</a> through many difficulties with his newly formed family: “I&nbsp;couldn’t get a&nbsp;job. It’s very challenging when you have babies, and you’re completely in&nbsp;debt,” he&nbsp;recalled. Luckily, his situation improved when he&nbsp;played Aquaman.</p><p>Despite his problems, the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>loves</a> being a&nbsp;dad. He&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;give his children what he&nbsp;lacked during his childhood, drawing inspiration from figures who served as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example to&nbsp;him while growing&nbsp;up: “Friends like <a href=# title="Chris Hemsworth" data-link=tag>Chris Hemsworth</a> or&nbsp;The Rock are incredible fathers, but my&nbsp;inspiration is&nbsp;my&nbsp;uncles. They were my&nbsp;idols.”</p><p>Thanks to&nbsp;the bonds he&nbsp;had with his uncles and grandfather, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;take them as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good father. His mom, whom he&nbsp;views as&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong and feisty woman, also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>got</a> his back: “My&nbsp;mom is&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist in&nbsp;every way,” the actor told. “She made me&nbsp;face my&nbsp;fears and explore the impossible to&nbsp;solve my&nbsp;problems.”</p><p>This has also led him to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>question</a> the concept of&nbsp;masculinity that he&nbsp;acquired from society. He&nbsp;believes expressing feelings is&nbsp;just as&nbsp;important as&nbsp;understanding sensitivity as&nbsp;a&nbsp;good quality to&nbsp;have. In&nbsp;that sense, he&nbsp;said, “I&nbsp;like people who can be&nbsp;open, who know how to&nbsp;approach me&nbsp;and bring out the best in&nbsp;me. Not being afraid to&nbsp;embrace sensitivity is&nbsp;also masculine. I&nbsp;learned that from my&nbsp;mother.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d4/589/f72801558196a67ad19084dc08.jpg><p>After several years of&nbsp;internal conflicts and fears, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>managed</a> to&nbsp;reconcile with his past. “I’m trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the best father&nbsp;I can&nbsp;be,” the actor said, adding, “I&nbsp;wasn’t raised by&nbsp;a&nbsp;man, I&nbsp;was raised by&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong woman, and&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;make peace with that too.”</p><p>Jason Momoa fulfilled his dream to&nbsp;have kids. And, although he&nbsp;is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;world-renowned actor known for his tough-guy style, he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;sensitive side that he&nbsp;seeks to&nbsp;stress in&nbsp;every moment of&nbsp;his life, both by&nbsp;being a&nbsp;loving father and by&nbsp;supporting his children in&nbsp;their dreams.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you like about this actor?
