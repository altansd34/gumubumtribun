She will join Season 4 winner Carrie Underwood on Saturday, April 30 for a night of unforgettable country music. Is Laci planning on releasing an album before this big performance?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-finalist-laci-kaye-booth-joins-stagecoach-2022-lineup>‘American Idol’ Finalist Laci Kaye Booth Joins Stagecoach 2022 Lineup</h2><p>Laci made the huge Stagecoach announcement on her Instagram page much to the delight of her 223,000 Instagram followers. She asked her followers to comment if they are planning on coming or not. Laci’s biggest fan, Katy Perry, wrote “IM COMING.” Perry broke down during Laci’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performance of “Dreams”</a> by Fleetwood Mac that she dedicated to her grandma during Season 17.</p><p>Perry said that Laci made her feel like a proud mom on the show. Little did she know she would become a mother to her first child <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Daisy Dove</a> just one year later. Perry even went as far as to call Laci her “favorite” after a stunning duet with country music star Brett Young. She was eliminated in the Top 5 but generated so much buzz throughout the season for being like the country version of Lana Del Rey.</p><p>Laci was initially announced to the Stagecoach lineup for April 2020. The festival was postponed and eventually canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She decided to make the move from Texas to Nashville like many <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">other American Idol contestants</a> looking to pursue their dream full time. Laci grew up writing songs on her own. She finally got the chance to work with other great songwriters in Music City.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CRPDtJ3L9ZN/</p></figure><p>“I learned so much on guitar that I never knew before,” Laci said after a songwriting session. “I learned how to open up to people and build relationships, even though I’m an introvert, I fell in love with a few outside songs, too. It’s Nashville, and I mean, amazing songs are everywhere. But after I gained that confidence in those writing rooms, I knew I definitely wanted to make it a point to write every song on my album. I’ll always write my own&nbsp;songs.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-hasn-t-laci-put-out-an-album-yet>Why Hasn’t Laci Put Out an Album Yet?</h2><p>During Season 18 of American Idol, it was announced that Laci had been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>signed to 19 Recordings</a> and Big Machine Label Group. This is a huge accomplishment for someone who did not win the show but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>gained a huge fanbase</a> from it. In October 2020, Laci revealed that she also has a publishing deal with UMPG Nashville and Big Machine Music. Fans have been waiting for her album since then.</p><p>She reunited with Season 17 winner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Laine Hardy</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friendsgiving: Live at The Ryman last year.</a> They grew an obvious friendship on the show and the idea of a collaboration would be epic. In December 2020, Laci posted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>behind-the-scenes photos</a> from the recording studio to tease that something was in the works. After releasing a few covers here and there, it looked like a big announcement was going to be made.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>hit the studio</a> multiple times last year. In May 2021, Laci posted an Instagram photo where she said she was going to record the rest of her album in her pajamas. Fans gathered in the comments section to rejoice about the fact that there is an album after all. She also posted a short clip of what looks to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>an upcoming music video.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CPbj5YqLja1/</p></figure><p>While we wait to hear an official album announcement from Laci, tickets for Stagecoach are set to go on sale on Friday.
