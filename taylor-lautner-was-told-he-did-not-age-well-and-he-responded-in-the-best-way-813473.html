In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent video, the actor decided to&nbsp;comment on&nbsp;how those negative remarks have affected his mental health and how he&nbsp;has been coping with them lately.</p><p><h2>The hateful remarks caught the actor’s attention on&nbsp;Instagram.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e2/4a5/0bee185e12a6a0822a30e566c8.jpg><p>Taylor Lautner is&nbsp;back in&nbsp;the limelight after an&nbsp;acting hiatus that lasted 6&nbsp;years between 2016 and 2022. Although many are happy to&nbsp;see the actor back on-screen, others have been anything but friendly towards him on&nbsp;social media.</p><p>On&nbsp;May&nbsp;22, 2023, Lautner posted a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> calling out the criticism he&nbsp;has been facing online, all due to&nbsp;natural physical changes that come with aging. “I&nbsp;just got back from a&nbsp;run. I&nbsp;was feeling really good about myself, trying to&nbsp;stay healthy both physically and mentally,” he&nbsp;started. “I&nbsp;felt compelled to&nbsp;share something with you because when&nbsp;I got back from that run, I&nbsp;hopped on&nbsp;Instagram (...) I&nbsp;was going through the comments [of&nbsp;a&nbsp;post], and it&nbsp;brought up&nbsp;old feelings and memories why&nbsp;I don’t look through comments.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0fb/fd0/f47cf45d6fa4e57a9605270fea.jpg><p>He&nbsp;then went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;show a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;the hurtful comments he&nbsp;saw that day as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;raise awareness about cyberbullying and mental health. The list included things such as&nbsp;“he&nbsp;did not age well” and “he&nbsp;looks so&nbsp;old,” among other stronger offenses.</p><p>“If&nbsp;this was 10&nbsp;years ago, 5&nbsp;years ago, maybe even 2, 3&nbsp;years ago, that really would have got under my&nbsp;skin,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>. “It&nbsp;would have caused me&nbsp;to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;just go&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hole and not go&nbsp;outside.”</p><p>However, the 31-year-old explained that although it&nbsp;still bothers him to&nbsp;read negative comments about himself, he’s mentally in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different place. “You find value where you put&nbsp;it,” Lautner pointed out. “And if&nbsp;you put your value in&nbsp;what other people think of&nbsp;you, that’s how you’re going to&nbsp;feel. But if&nbsp;you put your value in&nbsp;knowing who you are, what’s important to&nbsp;you, and what you love, that stuff won’t get to&nbsp;you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/744/ea0/afb69d546db6644e6140b2b5dd.jpg><p>The actor ended the video with a&nbsp;message of&nbsp;positivity and advice for everyone. “My&nbsp;biggest point is&nbsp;just think about and remember where you put your value in&nbsp;life, and also just be&nbsp;nice,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “It’s not that difficult. Let’s be&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;each other. Let’s spread love and positivity. It’s that simple.”</p><p><h2>Bonus: You can watch the full video here.</h2></p><p>Lautner has long been on&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey to&nbsp;live a&nbsp;more private life and to&nbsp;find happiness in&nbsp;the small things. He&nbsp;has since <a href=#>found his soulmate and got married</a>, so&nbsp;his decision to&nbsp;step away from the public eye seems to&nbsp;have been the right one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGixcuoqWakkarBr7HRZq6aq12pvK2wjKGcZpyZmXqvu9NmmKCdXayyrbiMmqWdZZiaerOx0qmmp5yVmXqquoytn55lkprAtXnWmrBmcGFogXh%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
