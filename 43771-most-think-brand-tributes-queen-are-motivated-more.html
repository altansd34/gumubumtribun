It has also led to questions about whether these efforts to pay tribute are genuine or not.</p><p>New YouGov data shows that seven in ten Britons say they’ve seen brand condolence messages (69%) from in the wake of the Queen’s death, with 17% saying they have not. But, when asked about these brands’ motivations, three in five members of the public say that they’re more driven by PR reasons than a sincere desire to pay their respects (58%), with just three in ten saying it’s more likely that these messages come from the heart (28%).</p><h3>The public are most likely to believe that tributes from brands with a royal connection are appropriate<strong></strong></h3><p>Our polling shows that not all corporate condolences are created equal. The public are most likely to think that tributes from brands with strong royal ties are appropriate: 83% think tributes from brands with a royal warrant are appropriate, while nearly as many say the same from of tourist attractions with a royal connection 81%.</p><p>Supermarkets are some way behind in the public’s estimation, with three in five (60%) saying their tributes are appropriate and a fifth (21%) saying they are inappropriate. It’s a similar story with tourist attractions that aren’t strongly affiliated with the royal family (59% appropriate vs 22% inappropriate), greeting card companies (57% vs 22%), and food companies (56% vs 23%).</p><p>At the very opposite end of the scale, most of the public think it’s inappropriate <a href=#>when lingerie and sex toy brands pay homage to the Queen</a> (54%), with just a quarter saying otherwise (27%). Gambling companies are close behind (32% appropriate vs 49% inappropriate).</p><p>So, well meant as tributes from Ann Summers and William Hill might be, the public would – on balance – prefer to hear from Fortnum & Mason’s and the Royal Botanic Gardens.</p><h3>Three quarters support school closures on the day of the Queen’s funeral</h3><p>The Queen’s upcoming funeral has left certain companies and institutions with the choice of carrying on as usual – or suspending activity to pay their respects.</p><p>Three-quarters of the public support school closures (77%) and museum closures (75%) closures on the day Her Majesty is laid to rest, with nearly as many saying the same of high street retailers (72%).</p><p>Most Britons also think it’s right to <a href=#>halt postal services</a> (66%), <a href=#>supermarket shopping</a> (65%) on the day of the funeral, and – despite outcry from the likes of Garys <a href=#>Lineker</a> and <a href=#>Neville</a> – a majority also support suspending football matches (56%) until after the event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGiEeH2MpqasrF2ptaq6ymaZq5memXq1vsibrK2do2K%2BtrHEp2SaqpViurDAyK%2BYrZ2UYrqwvsQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
