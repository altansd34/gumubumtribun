SNP MP Angus Robertson has previously called on an independent Scotland to <a href=#>join the Nordic Council</a>.</p><p>New <a href=#>YouGov Political Research</a> data shows this view of Scotland as having more in common with Scandinavian countries is reflected among the wider nationalist movement.</p><p>At least half of those who currently intend to vote for the SNP (52-61%) consider each of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden to be very or fairly similar countries to Scotland (compared to only 31% who say the same of England).</p><p>By contrast, far fewer (22-31%) of those who intend to vote for one of the major unionist parties (Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat) see Scotland as similar to any of the Nordic nations, while 62% see much in common with England.</p><p>The good news for Scottish nationalists is that most people in the two Nordic nations we surveyed – Denmark and Sweden – do see Scotland as similar to their own countries. The bad news is that they do not see Scotland as distinctly similar to them compared to England, or the wider UK.</p><p>While 58% of Danes and 56% of Swedes feel that Scotland is either very or fairly similar to their own countries, for England this figure is 62% and 61%, respectively. The slight discrepancy is because Scotland is slightly more unknown to the Nordic publics, rather than because they are more likely to see Scotland as dissimilar.</p><p>Similarly, 62% of Danes and 59% of Swedes consider the UK to be similar to their nations.</p><p>This is also a substantially lower level of similarity than Danes and Swedes give to other Nordic nations: 82-83% of Swedes see Denmark, Finland and Norway as similar nations, and 65% say the same of Iceland, while 86% of Danes see Sweden and Norway as similar to them and 71% say so of Finland and Iceland.</p><p><strong>See the Scotland results <a href=#>here</a> and the Denmark/Sweden results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktq%2FAxKulmqyZpLuiuI6aqa2hk6GytHuTbmlrbF2osLDAy5qlnWWjnrqquMCrZKybkaOxqrrAr6Capl2jrrW1zqeq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
