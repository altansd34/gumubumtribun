This post has stirred excitement and speculation among her fans who eagerly await her upcoming musical project.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ariana-grande-jokes-about-ag7-s-title-fans-speculate-it-will-release-soon>Ariana Grande Jokes About AG7’s Title, Fans Speculate It Will Release Soon</h2><p>In a recent Instagram carousel post, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grande</a> treated her fans to a glimpse of her day on a farm, embracing her role as a “goat mother.” The first photo featured her cuddling with a pair of adorable goats while wearing a chic cream coat. She also sported a farm-chic look in blue jeans and a soft beige sweater, with shoutouts to fashion brand Loewe and stylist Mimi Cuttrell.</p><p>The post even included moments with actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cynthia Erivo</a>, as they enjoyed some downtime together. A heartwarming snap showed Grande gazing at a dog while seated inside a guitar case, and there was also a playful video featuring her mother, Joan Grande, surrounded by a herd of goats, humorously exclaiming, “Oh no no no no, I’m handing you over to my daughter.” Grande’s laughter provided the soundtrack to her mother’s antics.</p><p>Grande’s recent post hinted at the upcoming release of her seventh album, reminding fans of her past pattern of teasing and quickly releasing new music. It seems likely that AG7’s release date might be sooner than expected, given her history with the release of her album Positions in 2020.</p><p>While Grande’s playful reference to Goat Mother has sparked excitement among her fans, it’s important to note that the official album title is unlikely going to be that. Moreover, fans should manage their expectations regarding the album’s release date, as the timing of album releases can be complex and planned well in advance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ariana-grande-confirmed-she-s-working-with-max-martin-for-ag7>Ariana Grande Confirmed She’s Working With Max Martin For AG7</h2><p>In the same post, Grande not only playfully hinted at the album title but also confirmed something that had previously been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored</a> – her collaboration with Swedish producer Max Martin for AG7.</p><p>In the Instagram carousel post, amidst heartwarming images of her bonding with goats and enjoying the serenity of the farm, one photo featured her longtime collaborator, Martin. This single photo has now solidified the rumors that Grande and Martin are indeed working together on her seventh album.</p><p>This news has sent waves of excitement through the fan community, as the dynamic duo has previously produced chart-topping hits like “Problem,” “Break Free,” and “Bang Bang” featuring Jessie J and Nicki Minaj.</p><p>Grande’s partnership with Martin confirms that AG7 is in progress.
