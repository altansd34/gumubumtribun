Her life has always been a&nbsp;tightrope walk, but this brave girl has achieved her <a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a> ambitions and touched everyone’s hearts, inspiring&nbsp;us all to&nbsp;be&nbsp;warriors and never give&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;rare genetic disease affecting her bones</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b33/01a/8e60b45b3ca3c5e2ee16a2610a.jpg><p>Hannah Tyre is&nbsp;a&nbsp;27-year-old girl living in&nbsp;Georgia, USA. Like every girl her age, Hannah enjoys a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;hobbies, and makeup is&nbsp;among them. But, unlike others, she leads a&nbsp;unique lifestyle, and her everyday activities may have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;altered due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare genetic disease that has affected her since she was a&nbsp;newborn, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>osteogenesis imperfecta</a>.</p><p>“I&nbsp;literally just say, like, I&nbsp;have brittle bones disease, meaning that<strong> my&nbsp;bones just break very easily,</strong>” Hannah says, attempting to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>describe </a>her rare condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/51c/f69/261a565f2eae835a3036767b9c.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Osteogenesis</a> prevents the body from building strong bones; it&nbsp;comes in&nbsp;many forms, and each can present its own challenges. The signs and symptoms of&nbsp;this disorder might be&nbsp;mild to&nbsp;severe, but it&nbsp;can affect our whole life and how we&nbsp;conduct everyday tasks.</p><p>Hannah, and many others like her, require specific equipment for their condition, allowing them to&nbsp;accomplish everyday things. Hannah <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “The biggest challenge in&nbsp;my&nbsp;disease is&nbsp;always trying to&nbsp;look for places that are handicapped accessible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05b/d51/0427085995b79ab083084b1ad9.jpg><p>Hannah’s life may be&nbsp;relatively normal because her family supports her and has been by&nbsp;her since birth. “I&nbsp;need help to&nbsp;get <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dressed</a> during the day and to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;and out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;wheelchair or&nbsp;bathing,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a>, “<strong>sometimes it&nbsp;frustrates me&nbsp;I can’t be&nbsp;more independent</strong>.”</p><p>Hannah’s mother is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important figure in&nbsp;her life, and she has given her all to&nbsp;her daughter since they first learned of&nbsp;her condition. Cindy, Hannah’s mother, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a> how young she was when she gave birth to&nbsp;Hannah and how horrified she was to&nbsp;learn that her child had fractured bones.</p><p><h2>Through her love for makeup, she’s reached millions of&nbsp;people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c55/f8c/d60a5f53559e4b29623445e899.jpg><p>Despite the difficulties posed by&nbsp;her <a href=# title=disabilities data-link=tag>disabilities</a>, Hannah was persistent in&nbsp;pursuing her makeup passion, enabling her to&nbsp;run her own <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> pages and reach <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>millions</a> of&nbsp;people. Since she started making videos, Hannah has been able to&nbsp;get into the hearts of&nbsp;all who watch her.</p><p>Other than bringing attention to&nbsp;her disability, Hannah serves as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;how you don’t have to&nbsp;look a&nbsp;certain way to&nbsp;feel beautiful because you have to&nbsp;discover your beauty. She said, “Blogging has definitely given me&nbsp;more confidence, making me&nbsp;realize&nbsp;I can do&nbsp;many more things, and it&nbsp;improved my&nbsp;self-<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>esteem</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f8/55f/4c8ab05460b5c2d82d8024145e.jpg><p>Hannah may struggle to&nbsp;get by&nbsp;every day, and even something as&nbsp;simple as&nbsp;sneezing can be&nbsp;critical. Showing off her makeup to&nbsp;her fans while wearing&nbsp;it, on&nbsp;the other hand, has helped her overcome these obstacles and find solace in&nbsp;it. “I&nbsp;don’t think that I’m any different from anybody else, people with disabilities are not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>different</a>.”</p><p>Hannah <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “<strong>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;show people with disabilities that you can do&nbsp;this</strong> too,” She stated. “I&nbsp;think it’s really awesome that the beauty industry is&nbsp;becoming more diverse and really showcasing different beauty, and I’m proud to&nbsp;somewhat have a&nbsp;little part to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c7/161/5521c15aa4a7df3d90b7a4d691.jpg><p>When you’re feeling down, who do&nbsp;you turn to&nbsp;for comfort, and where do&nbsp;you find&nbsp;it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5us8iro2avmam1brPLmqqsZZKku6a%2FjJ6lnKelp66osdJmp56noKGybsPIrZ9mnJmorqO1y6Krop2jYsGwec%2BuqaytlWLBqbHIq2SdqpWWurR5l2pna2xjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
