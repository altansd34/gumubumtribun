They are also excellent hunters who can help&nbsp;us avoid domestic pests and rodents. And it&nbsp;was this hunting skill that began a&nbsp;whole story, that ended with the creation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;charity. Okay, we&nbsp;know it’s hard to&nbsp;see the connection between these 2&nbsp;facts, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;will tell you everything from the beginning.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry to&nbsp;share this story with you about a&nbsp;cat who has found a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;get money from strangers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/992/bba/844d275f05a7695513cd94b2a8.jpg><p><a href=#>This lovely kitty</a> was adopted by&nbsp;the owner of&nbsp;the marketing agency GuRuStu, in&nbsp;Tulsa. The thing was that they needed to&nbsp;keep mice away, and having a&nbsp;cat was a&nbsp;great solution to&nbsp;help solve this problem. This fluffy guy quickly joined the team and started to&nbsp;love sitting by&nbsp;the window and watching what was happening on&nbsp;the street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/49b/ae4/6a49b85935a158e9f10bec98ab.jpg><p>And all this seemed normal, an&nbsp;ordinary cat watching people passing&nbsp;by. But suddenly, the team found money on&nbsp;the floor near the door. They couldn’t understand where it&nbsp;had come from. The situation repeated itself again and again, and they were at&nbsp;a&nbsp;loss for how this was possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c99/972/b6602456a2b51fcab4ef06a535.jpg><p>However, later they came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;theory. The company’s office is&nbsp;located in&nbsp;the entertainment district. And a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people walk past the office door. So, what if&nbsp;people used money to&nbsp;play with the cat?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/77d/ef8/7f18025f5aa8cdef89eb7c3399.jpg><p>They decided to&nbsp;test their hunch and tried to&nbsp;slide a&nbsp;bill into the slot in&nbsp;the door. And the result didn’t keep itself waiting. The cat quickly reacted and grabbed&nbsp;it. The theory turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;true. And this is&nbsp;how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>The cat with an&nbsp;unusual talent became really popular, and many people would come by&nbsp;to&nbsp;play with him. Because of&nbsp;this, more money appeared inside the door and the team decided to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;worthy cause they could donate it&nbsp;to. They decided to&nbsp;give this money to&nbsp;a&nbsp;charity called Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless, because there are lots of&nbsp;homeless people in&nbsp;the area and the kitty himself was also homeless once.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30c/214/acf43357b492aa82b62d76483b.jpg><p>This adorable thief became known as&nbsp;the <a href=#>CASHnip Kitty</a> and people started to&nbsp;send him money and support this sweet guy. He&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;help people in&nbsp;need and lives a&nbsp;joyful cat life. But he&nbsp;will never be&nbsp;an&nbsp;ordinary cat. This little fluffy has some big power and he&nbsp;changes lives for the better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/27f/590/e6999b579ba6596261cbaf4c1b.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cba/cd2/91345752d8aacbf4c1f4e9055d.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e5/0fb/250ba6584d8c414ada40be9411.jpg><p>Would you play with this kitty?
