But the French influence on the world of dance is best exemplified by ballet.&nbsp;</p><p>Ballet itself — as well as the language of ballet — has become a French national treasure and global export. Though the trend nowadays is for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English words to infiltrate the French language</a>, the opposite is true with ballet. In fact, learning the meaning behind various French ballet terms is an extra step you can take to dance your way into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning French</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Why-are-so-many-ballet-terms-in-French?>Why are so many ballet terms in French?</h2><p>It’s a fair question to ask, especially when you consider that the word “ballet” actually comes from the Italian verb ballare (to dance).&nbsp;</p><p>The origins of ballet can be traced back to Italy, where it first appeared at court during the 16th-century Italian Renaissance. It was Catherine de Medici who imported ballet to France when she married French King Henri II in 1533. The dance quickly grew in popularity and, in the 17th century, the codes of ballet were defined in France under the influence of King Louis XIV — himself a dancer and patron of the arts.&nbsp;</p><p>Louis founded the Académie royale de danse (Royal Dance Academy) in 1661 and the Académie royale de musique (Royal Music Academy) in 1669. In time, this led to the creation of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ballet de l’Opéra national de Paris</a> (Paris National Opera Ballet). To this day, the dance company is one of the most prestigious in the world.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6-French-words-from-professional-ballet>6 French words from professional ballet</h2><p>Like the dance itself, the world of professional ballet is very much codified.

This influence is also visible in the vocabulary of ballet, with many ballet terms borrowed from (or invented in) the French language.
