His double album Dangerous <a href=#>became even more popular</a> after the scandal, and he recently released a new acoustic performance of his song “865.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-morgan-wallen-releases-new-acoustic-performance-of-865>Morgan Wallen Releases New Acoustic Performance of ‘865’</h2><p>Wallen’s song “865” is about drunk-dialing an ex. The track actually includes a full phone number, with the area code for Knoxville, Tennessee, and surrounding counties. <a href=#>Taste of Country</a> reports that the number is connected with the automated service U.S. Telepunch.</p><p>The 28-year-old singer is from Sneedville, Tennessee. Wallen told <a href=#>Whiskey Riff</a> that the area code “makes me think of home,” adding, “whoever’s number that is, I am extremely sorry.”</p><p>Wallen’s new acoustic performance is part of <a href=# class=broken_link>The Dangerous Sessions</a>, a series of videos in which he performs tracks from his sophomore album. This is the first addition to the series since January, when the album was first released, shortly before video was leaked of him using the N-word.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>POST-REHAB MORGAN WALLEN TAKES TEQUILA SHOT ON STAGE WITH LUKE BRYAN</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wallen-bounced-back-quickly-from-this-year-s-scandal>Wallen Bounced Back Quickly from This Year’s Scandal</h3><p>Wallen, who competed on The Voice Season 6, didn’t have to work very hard to bounce back from controversy over <a href=#>his use of the N-word</a>. Despite being suspended by his label and becoming ineligible for some awards, his album gained popularity.</p><p>The singer is <a href=#>kicking off a tour this month</a> called Morgan Wallen’s Country Thunder Takeover. He also performed at a charity concert in Nashville and joined American Idol judge Luke Bryan on stage earlier this year. Wallen’s album Dangerous was even nominated for a CMA.</p><p>Wallen’s new acoustic “865” video currently has over 250,000 views after being posted on Tuesday. Fans seem to have forgiven him quickly for the scandal, as a scroll through the video’s comments shows plenty of positive feedback.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-131802146.jpg alt="David Archuleta Gets Dangerous on Cool New Track ‘Beast’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>morgan wallen</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zKipoJmeYsSiuMuepWaqlaGyor%2FErGSnnadirqS71KyroptdpbKzss6rpJqmk5p6sLKMoaCsZaOku6h5l29saA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
