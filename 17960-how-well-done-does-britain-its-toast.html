Now a new YouGov survey finds that only one in fifty Brits like their own toast charred to a crisp.</p><p>This is perhaps just as well, with the UK Food Standards Agency saying in January that foods like singed toast <a href=#>could increase a person’s risk of cancer</a>.</p><p>When shown five numbered photos of toast – each number corresponding to the number settings on a toaster* – the majority of Brits (53%) opted for the golden brown toast produced by toaster setting 3.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Toast-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>A quarter of Brits (24%) prefer their toast to be the deep brown provided by the number 4 setting, whilst a further 19% like their toast lightly browned (setting 2). Just one in a hundred Brits (1%) prefer the barely hardened bread you get from toaster setting 1.</p><p><strong>Toast toppings</strong></p><p>Butter is by far the nation’s favourite toast topping, with nearly three quarters (73%) liking it on a slice. Butter is far more popular than butter-alikes, with only 30% liking margarine/spread on their toast. Additionally, cheese on toast is enjoyed by 51% of Brits, while a similar proportion (50%) like jam.</p><p>Marmalade splits the generations. Just on in six (17%) of 18-24 year olds like it on their toast, a figure which rises to more than six in ten (62%) Brits aged 65 or older. By contrast, chocolate spreads go in the other direction. While 46% of young people like toppings such as Nutella on their toast, among older consumers this dips to just 7%.</p><p>*As a side effect of the study, YouGov can confirm that the numbers on your toaster do not represent how many minutes the bread will be toasted for</p><p>Photo: Marcus Rojo Instagram</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWyGd3yMoaawZaeaua15w6ilnmWUpLK0ecGroK2ZmaN6qsDSZquomaOp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
