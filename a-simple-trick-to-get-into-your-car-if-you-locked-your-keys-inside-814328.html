Take a&nbsp;roll of&nbsp;broad duct tape, cut a&nbsp;length of&nbsp;it, and stick it&nbsp;vertically to&nbsp;a&nbsp;window glass. Now repeat it&nbsp;5&nbsp;or 6&nbsp;more times, sticking the lengths of&nbsp;tape next to&nbsp;each other. When done, unstick the bottom parts of&nbsp;all the lengths on&nbsp;the window and wring them together in&nbsp;a&nbsp;single ‘tail’ that you can hold and leave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;hang for the time being.</p><p>Now cut another 5&nbsp;or 6&nbsp;lengths and stick them across the ones you’ve already stuck so&nbsp;that they hold fast. Once everything’s ready, hold the ‘tail’ you made previously, and <strong>3, 2, 1, PULL&nbsp;DOWN!</strong> With a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;an&nbsp;effort, the window will slide down a&nbsp;bit, and you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;stick your hands between the glass and the frame to&nbsp;push it&nbsp;down further until you can get inside and fetch those keys.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f08/ae2/ed84215cb7a6320f8eb6cc9728.png><p>Not all of&nbsp;us are great parkers, let’s face&nbsp;it. You might’ve scraped your car a&nbsp;little now and then when you weren’t being too careful. Pick up&nbsp;a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;those awesome rubber chickens that squawk when you squeeze them. <strong>Warning</strong>: you will look ridiculous, but you’ll never scratch your car up&nbsp;again!</p><p>Ok, get them out before parking, and hook them to&nbsp;the front and back corners of&nbsp;your car. When you get too close to&nbsp;a&nbsp;post or&nbsp;wall, or&nbsp;someone else’s car, the chickens will belt out their epic song! And if&nbsp;you keep going anyway, they’ll act as&nbsp;a&nbsp;soft bumper to&nbsp;protect your paint job!</p><p>Leave your wipers up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the winter. It’ll prevent them from sticking to&nbsp;the windshield, so&nbsp;you don’t have to&nbsp;scrape them off and break the rubber. People warn against it&nbsp;because they say it&nbsp;ruins the arm’s spring and makes your wipers more vulnerable to&nbsp;thieves.</p><p>But&nbsp;<strong>A)</strong> the “wearing down the arm” thing isn’t true&nbsp;— the springs don’t lose their elasticity, and&nbsp;<strong>B)</strong> who’s going around stealing people’s wiper blades? If&nbsp;you’re still going to&nbsp;keep the wipers down (or&nbsp;you forgot to&nbsp;put them up&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;freezing night), run the AC! Yes, cold air will defrost the windows just like the heating does! It&nbsp;works by&nbsp;dehumidifying the air. Great trick for when your heating is&nbsp;busted!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/103/094/75d1885d3897a2bdf3db31ac40.png><p>Actually, you can prevent your windshield from getting frosty in&nbsp;the first place. Spray a&nbsp;3-parts-<strong><a href=# title=vinegar data-link=tag>vinegar</a></strong>-to-1-part-<strong><a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a></strong> solution on&nbsp;the windows the night beforehand. It’ll save you some scraping time in&nbsp;the morning!</p><p>Your wipers will break down sooner or&nbsp;later, even if&nbsp;you keep them up&nbsp;every winter. If&nbsp;the rubber’s coming off and the metal arm is&nbsp;scraping your windshield, just put a&nbsp;long sock on&nbsp;it! It’s a&nbsp;temporary fix, but it&nbsp;works! Just get yourself some new blades ASAP...</p><p>To&nbsp;save yourself some time and nerve on&nbsp;a&nbsp;winter morning, protect your car doors from getting frozen overnight. This happens because of&nbsp;snow that gets into the seals, turns into water and freezes again in&nbsp;there. To&nbsp;stop that vicious circle, put <strong>cooking spray</strong> on&nbsp;all the inside rubber parts and then wipe off the extras with a&nbsp;paper towel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/93e/7e4/1614af540db704ae5411ededa0.png><p>Car batteries don’t really enjoy extremely cold temperatures. In&nbsp;fact, when the frost is&nbsp;extreme, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;really harmful to&nbsp;your car battery if&nbsp;you don’t warm it&nbsp;up&nbsp;first. Just turn your headlights on&nbsp;for a&nbsp;little bit and then turn on&nbsp;the car engine. You can also warm it&nbsp;up&nbsp;with the radio and listen to&nbsp;some music to&nbsp;make the waiting more enjoyable.<strong></strong></p><p>When your windows fog from the inside, it&nbsp;makes driving pretty dangerous. Luckily, a&nbsp;humble <a href=# title=potato data-link=tag>potato</a> can come to&nbsp;your rescue! Take a&nbsp;clean and raw one, cut it&nbsp;in&nbsp;half and rub one half on&nbsp;the windows from the inside. It&nbsp;will clean them and also create a&nbsp;protective layer to&nbsp;prevent fogging. Then let the potato coating dry without touching&nbsp;it. This trick will also work on&nbsp;your shower door and bathroom mirror.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’re stuck in&nbsp;the snow or&nbsp;mud, you can use your car’s rubber mats to&nbsp;get yourself out. Put them under your tires to&nbsp;add traction. The kitty litter trick works too, but who’s driving around with THAT in&nbsp;the car? Oh, don’t forget your mats back there.</p><p>In&nbsp;case the car mats don’t help, try deflating the tires a&nbsp;bit. This will help increase the service area of&nbsp;the tires and again, get them more traction. Remember you can only make them look slightly flat and as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you get out of&nbsp;the snow you gotta pump them back&nbsp;up!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e91/5ef/f2f17b5ed6b51e730357b18648.png><p>If&nbsp;your car ever got stuck in&nbsp;mud or&nbsp;sand on&nbsp;a&nbsp;rainy day ride through the woods, you know how scary it&nbsp;gets. The good news&nbsp;is: you can get out using a&nbsp;shovel and some patience! Try to&nbsp;clear as&nbsp;much mud and sand as&nbsp;you can from around the wheels using a&nbsp;shovel or&nbsp;even your own hands. If&nbsp;your car still won’t move, try switching from reverse to&nbsp;drive to&nbsp;start gaining momentum and deflate your tires to&nbsp;increase their surface area.</p><p>Getting your speed up&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>70&nbsp;mph</strong> for <strong>10&nbsp;mi </strong>once a&nbsp;month (on&nbsp;an&nbsp;open freeway in&nbsp;clear dry conditions, of&nbsp;course!) evaporates any water and gas buildup in&nbsp;the engine and exhaust system. It&nbsp;gets you there a&nbsp;little bit faster, but again only do&nbsp;it&nbsp;when it’s appropriate.</p><p>If&nbsp;you often can’t find your car in&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge parking lot, remember to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;the spot or&nbsp;row number as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you pull&nbsp;in. There are also GPS apps that help you find your car among endless parking spaces and huge garages!</p><p>If&nbsp;you didn’t take a&nbsp;picture or&nbsp;decided not to&nbsp;download that app, you can find your car with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;remote key. The signal doesn’t reach? Then bring it&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;your head. Fluids in&nbsp;your head boost the conductivity of&nbsp;key signals. It’s crazy, but it&nbsp;works!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ad4/407/01847b55e8814988f4c2195ba8.png><p>Those metal bars in&nbsp;your headrest aren’t only for adjusting the height. You can also use them to&nbsp;break the windows in&nbsp;an&nbsp;emergency. It&nbsp;works better if&nbsp;you push it&nbsp;into the gap at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the window, pull it&nbsp;toward you, and the glass will shatter.</p><p>If&nbsp;you don’t have a&nbsp;phone holder in&nbsp;your car or&nbsp;maybe yours suddenly came unstuck, you can thread a&nbsp;rubber band through your&nbsp;AC vent. Insert the rubber band through the top of&nbsp;the vent and pull the other half through the bottom. Then put your phone in&nbsp;it, and you’re good to&nbsp;go!</p><p>When you get out of&nbsp;the car, your clothes sliding against the seat fabric creates some static charge. Seems innocent, but not when you’re at&nbsp;a&nbsp;gas station. When you grab that metallic nozzle, a&nbsp;spark can happen. Just like when you accidentally shock someone, right?</p><p>Only, instead of&nbsp;giggling and seeing if&nbsp;you can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;your friend again, that tiny spark can light up&nbsp;those gas vapors! To&nbsp;dispel any electric charge on&nbsp;you, just touch a&nbsp;metal part of&nbsp;your vehicle before you reach for the nozzle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/08b/3b3/cd19105856875747f910cfaab8.png><p>Speaking about gas stations, when you arrive to&nbsp;refuel, you might spend ten minutes looking for your gas tank only to&nbsp;find out it’s on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the vehicle. Fortunately, you don’t have to&nbsp;play the guessing game anymore. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;little arrow by&nbsp;the fuel icon on&nbsp;your dashboard that tells you which side the tank is&nbsp;on! That one has saved my&nbsp;bacon numerous times.</p><p>Dishwashing liquid can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good and cheap way to&nbsp;clean your car windows and windshield. It&nbsp;will help you get rid of&nbsp;anything from fingerprints to&nbsp;dog slobber. Just grab a&nbsp;damp and warm washcloth, use a&nbsp;drop of&nbsp;dishwashing liquid, and start cleaning. Plungers are actually pretty useful outside of&nbsp;kitchens and bathrooms. For example, you can use a&nbsp;cup plunger to&nbsp;fix small and medium-sized dents in&nbsp;your car. Wet both the dent and the plunger and use it&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were unclogging a&nbsp;drain&nbsp;— push and pull&nbsp;— until it&nbsp;comes out.</p><p>One thing that makes coke an&nbsp;excellent and cheap way to&nbsp;remove tarnish and rust from metals and alloys is&nbsp;that it’s <strong>carbonated</strong> and rich in&nbsp;<strong>phosphoric acid</strong>. So&nbsp;that’s two things. Just spray the rusty surface with coke, and then use a&nbsp;brush or&nbsp;a&nbsp;toothbrush if&nbsp;the area is&nbsp;small to&nbsp;break it&nbsp;up. Apply and scrub as&nbsp;necessary. Don’t forget to&nbsp;clean the scrubbed area with water after you’re done.</p><p>The heavier your vehicle&nbsp;is, the more gas it&nbsp;uses. The engine has to&nbsp;burn through more of&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep the car moving. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you keep two picnic chairs, your dumbbells, your golf clubs, and a&nbsp;bag of&nbsp;clothes you wanted to&nbsp;donate months ago in&nbsp;your trunk, it’s really high time you gave it&nbsp;a&nbsp;good clean-up.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uv8imp6WdXam%2Fqq%2FKZquoZZeawW61za2mZrGfqr9ur8CrZKKeXa68tnnLqJqknZRixrDB0WainrGjYravv8idnGZwYWmAc4SO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
