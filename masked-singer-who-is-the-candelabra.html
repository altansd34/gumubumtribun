For One Hit Wonders Week, we’re meeting our last group of singers. One of those is the Candelabra, reminiscent of Lumière from Beauty and the Beast, but from the preview, this light fixture can SING.</strong></p><p>So what clues reveal the identity of the celebrity under the Candelabra mask? And who is it? Here’s our full rundown of everything you need to know about the Candelabra.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGGQ89XwhAc</p>Candelabra performing “1 Thing” by Amerie on The Masked Singer One Hit Wonders Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 10</h2><p>The Candelabra started her clues in a castle, saying that “from a young age, [she] always had a fire burning inside her.” She then calls Kevin Hart. At 12 years old, “sitting up in [her] room,” she called performers from her hometown, begging them to give her a chance to perform. Finally, one said yes and her career “ignited.”</p><p>Candelabra claims she was “burning the candle at both ends” trying to keep her career going though. We see a picture frame with a butterfly on it, potentially referring to Michelle Williams who was the Butterfly on The Masked Singer. She says she has fans all over the world and “plenty of accolades.” While claiming the she’s “proud of where [her] drive has taken [her],” we see a picture of the state of California. At the end, she picks up a present that says “For Santa’s Naughty List” on it.</p><p>For her final clue, the Men in Black play “Two Princes.” Candelabra questions, “Who needs two princes when you have one FIRE princess?!”</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RITA ORA TO REPLACE NICOLE SCHERZINGER ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 11</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Candelabra</h2><p>Ken knew “EXACTLY who this is,” saying it’s Mariah Carey or Regina Hall. But Nicole thought it was Brandy. Robin predicted it’s a recording artist, particularly Annika Noni Rose. The guessing game has begun online to try to figure out the identity of the Candelabra too. Fans online have guessed it could be H.E.R., Keyshia Cole, or Tiffany Haddish.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Candelabra on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>After One Hit Wonders Night, it’s clear who the Candelabra is! And we’re predicting that it is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-keyshia-cole>Keyshia Cole!</h3><p>Aside from the voice and stage presence, all the clues align too. Keyshia is from California, so those clues make sense. And specifically, she’s from Oakland, which is also where MC Hammer is from, who gave her her first shot on stage. So it’s not a stretch to believe the calling performers from her hometown story is true for Keyshia! The phone call to Kevin Hart could also be a nod to her album “Calling All Hearts.”</p><p>Keyshia Cole definitely has fans all over the world and plenty of accolades, including multiple Grammy nominations. The butterfly in the picture frame could be for her butterfly tattoo or the beef that she had with Michelle Williams after the Destiny’s Child reunion at the Super Bowl Halftime Show. The gift mentioning the naughty list is a reference to her last name, Cole, as well as her recording of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.” And finally, she’s known as the “Princess of Hip-Hop Soul” so that explains the “Two Princes” clue!</p><p>Check back here every week for more reveals and clues breakdowns, and tune in to The Masked Singer, Wednesdays at 8/7c on FOX.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_Anteater_MichaelBecker_Fox-220x147.jpg alt="Who is the Anteater? ‘The Masked Singer’ Prediction & Clues!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZOWu6Wxy5qZq5lf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
