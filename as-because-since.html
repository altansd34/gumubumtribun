Their job is to introduce a subordinate<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> clause</a> and connect a reason to a result in a sentence.&nbsp;</p><p>That means you can use them all the same way, right?</p><p>Well, kind of, but not exactly. Despite the fact that these words have similar jobs (to introduce a subordinate clause), they’re not identical.</p><p>If you’re an<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> English learner</a>, you know that this can be the source of a lot of confusion. How do you know when to use “since,” “as” or “because” to ensure you have correct<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> grammar</a>?</p><p>Don’t worry—we’re going to clear a few things up for you. Let’s discuss the differences between these conjunctions and how to use each one.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-use-“because”>How to use “because”</h2><p>The causal conjunction “because” is the most common and informal of the three conjunctions we’re discussing—and probably the least confusing too. Its typical form is <strong>because + subject + verb</strong>.</p><p>Here are some of its main features:</p><ul><li>“Because” sentences are more focused on the reason rather than the result.</li></ul><p><strong>Example: </strong>“He was late for work today because there was a lot of traffic.”&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the sentence is to provide a reason for his lateness.</p><ul><li>As a conjunction, “Because” is more common in the middle of a sentence than at the beginning</li></ul><p><strong>Example: </strong>A sentence like<strong> </strong>“I can’t come to the party because I’m sick” is a little more natural than “Because I’m sick, I can’t come to the party.”</p><ul><li>However, “because” can be used at the beginning of a sentence (often in a slightly more formal context).</li></ul><p><strong>Example: </strong>“Because our fundraiser was such a success, we can now afford to renovate the school gymnasium.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You can use “because” to ask a question in which you’re suggesting an answer.</li></ul><p><strong>Example: </strong>“Are you going to take a vacation because you’re so stressed out?”</p><ul><li>When you’re speaking or writing informally, you can start a sentence with “because” to answer a question.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Example: Speaker 1: </strong>“Why do you look so sad today?”</p><p><strong>Speaker 2: </strong>“Because my best friend just moved to another country.”</p><ul><li>You can use <strong>“because of” +</strong> <strong>noun/noun phrase</strong> to provide an explanation.</li></ul><p><strong>Example: </strong>I’ve been<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> shopping</a> much less often because of the price of groceries.”</p><p>Here, the price is the direct cause and reason for not shopping too often.</p><p>When you use because as a subordinating conjunction, no comma is needed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to use “as” and “since”</h2><p>Although they’re not identical, “as” and “since” are used similarly, so we’re going to look at them together. These two conjunctions are both more formal than “because” and are slightly less strong when it comes to making a link between a reason and a result. Their form is <strong>as/since + subject + verb</strong>.</p><p>Here are a few more details:</p><ul><li>“As” and “since” focus more on the result of a sentence rather than the reason.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Example: </strong>“My daughter is unhappy at school as her teacher is unkind to her.”&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the sentence is to highlight that your daughter is unhappy at school, which is the result of her teacher being unkind.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “We’re looking for a house since we’ve outgrown our apartment.”&nbsp;</p><p>The focus here is on trying to find a house—the result of having an apartment that’s too small.</p><ul><li>Starting a sentence with a “since” or “as” clause is common.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Example: </strong>“As I have an appointment this afternoon, I won’t be available to work.”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“Since<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Christmas</a> is next month, I need to start buying some gifts!”</p><ul><li>“Since” is also an adverb indicating the passage of time from a specific point in the past until the present, so it can sometimes cause confusion in a sentence.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Example: </strong>“He’s been in a good mood since he<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> quit his job</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s why that sentence is confusing: It’s unclear whether this means “He’s been in a good mood from the moment he quit his job up until the present time” or “He’s been in a good mood because he quit his job.”&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Similarly, “as” is an adverb that means “while”—this can also be confusing if your sentence isn’t clear.</li></ul><p><strong>Example:</strong> “She smiled as she was eating her favorite<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> meal</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Does this mean that she smiled while she was eating her favorite meal, or because she was eating her favorite meal?</p><p>If you find that there is some ambiguity and your sentence might be misinterpreted like the above examples, try rewording it so there’s no room for misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-use-“for”>How to use “for”</h2><p>The conjunctive word “for” serves as a connector, indicating a reason or cause in a sentence. Its typical structure involves “for” + subject + verb.</p><p>Similar to “because,” “for” focuses on providing a reason or explanation for a particular situation or action. However, it tends to be a bit more formal and less common in everyday speech compared to “because.”</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> She chose to pursue a career in art, for her passion and talent knew no bounds</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: The crowd erupted into cheers, for their team had emerged victorious against all odds.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: They dared to challenge the boundaries of human knowledge, for they believed that within the uncharted territories lay the answers to their deepest questions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>As vs. because vs. since: Know the subtle differences</strong></h2><p>Although we’ve gone through the key features of these causal conjunctions, the truth is that the differences between them are sometimes not very obvious.</p><p>To get a good grasp of this topic, review the information above, try putting it into practice whenever possible and, whenever you’re in doubt, using “because” is a pretty safe bet!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>FAQs about how to use ”since”, ”as”, ”because”, ”for”, and more</strong></h2><p>Here are also some of the questions people ask about using conjunctions to connect clauses in English</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How do you introduce subordinate clauses in English?</strong></h3><p>In English, such clauses are introduced by subordinating conjunctions, such as “because,” “although,” “while,” and “if,” among others. These conjunctions connect the subordinate clause to the main clause, indicating a dependent relationship between the two.</p><p>Here is an example that shows cause and effect: “He is feeling unwell because he ate too much.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What types of subordinate clauses do you have in English?</strong></h3><p>In English, there are adverbial clauses, relative clauses, and noun clauses, expressing different meanings of dependency.</p><p>Adverbial clauses modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, indicating time, place, manner, condition, reason, or purpose. Relative clauses provide additional information about a noun. Noun clauses function as nouns within a sentence, often serving as subjects, objects, or complements.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Can you start a sentence with a “ because clause”?</strong></h3><p>Yes, you can start a sentence with a “because clause” if it is followed by an independent clause. However, it’s important to use proper punctuation and consider the logical relationship between the clauses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How do you use “since” as a preposition?</strong></h3><p>‘Since’ acts as a preposition denoting a duration commencing from a specific moment in the past and persisting until the present (present perfect) or another past event (past perfect).</p><p>For instance: I haven’t seen Mike since July 14.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How do you link independent clauses?</strong></h3><p>To link independent clauses in English, you use a coordinating conjunction like “and,” “but,” “or,” “nor,” “for,” “so,” and “yet.”</p><p>For instance: “She reads books, and he watches movies.”, “She wanted to walk, but it rained.” “You can have tea or coffee.” These conjunctions help create clear, cohesive sentences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Summing up: As vs. because vs. since</strong></h2><p>So, understanding the nuances between “as,” “because,” and “since” is crucial for effective communication in English. While these causal conjunctions all introduce subordinate clauses to connect reasons with results, they each carry subtle distinctions in meaning and usage.</p><p>“Because” is the most common and informal, emphasizing the reason behind an action and is often used to answer questions or provide explanations in both formal and informal contexts.</p><p>“As” and “since,” focus more on the result of a situation rather than the reason itself. These conjunctions can often be found at the beginning of sentences and are commonly used in written English.</p><p>While less common in everyday speech, “for” provides an alternative to “because,” offering a more formal tone.</p><p>Despite their similarities, it’s essential to recognize the differences between these causal conjunctions to convey your message accurately and avoid ambiguity.&nbsp;</p><p>By understanding their grammar, explaining the differences, and practicing their usage, you can effectively convey causation in your writing and speech.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Andrea-1.jpg><h2>Andrea Byaruhanga</h2><p>Andrea is a Canadian freelance writer and editor specializing in English, e-learning, EdTech, and SaaS.
