If&nbsp;you think being a&nbsp;pirate or&nbsp;a&nbsp;sailor back in&nbsp;the old days was so&nbsp;cool, here’s the harsh truth: it&nbsp;was not all about singing sea shanties and embarking on&nbsp;epic voyages across the seven seas to&nbsp;find the fountain of&nbsp;youth or&nbsp;caves filled with gold. It&nbsp;wasn’t actually that cool being at&nbsp;sea all the time, and&nbsp;I have five compelling reasons to&nbsp;prove you&nbsp;so.</p><p>Let’s dive&nbsp;in! Pun intended! Now, imagine this. You’re so&nbsp;excited! You’ve been waiting for this day to&nbsp;come, and finally, it’s official. You’re going to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;real sailor! The captain tells you to&nbsp;get ready because the next day, you’re going to&nbsp;set sail on&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey that is&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;take somewhere around six months&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you’re lucky, that&nbsp;is... Because storms and singing mermaids could complicate things. You pack a&nbsp;few things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/764/e0f/58a6665c80a1bcc8b2d41c55e9.png><p>Now, let’s pause this daydream for a&nbsp;quick second because here comes problem number one. What I&nbsp;mean by&nbsp;packing a&nbsp;few things is&nbsp;just the <a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a> on&nbsp;your back. Sailors would only have one set of&nbsp;clothes that they almost never washed during the voyage. That’s because they believed that dirt and grease would protect them from winds and rains.</p><p>Okay, back to&nbsp;the thought experiment. You kiss your <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> goodbye and head to&nbsp;the port where your new home is&nbsp;waiting. One of&nbsp;your crew members not-so-warmly welcomes you on&nbsp;the deck and shows you where you’ll be&nbsp;sleeping. This makes you start doubting your choice of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;sailor in&nbsp;the first place. Because after seeing&nbsp;it, you’re certain that this is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;5-star hotel comfort level kind of&nbsp;experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/050/a9a/d6adef558b92c0935010da0d2e.png><p>So, here’s problem number two. The ships were absolutely crammed. Back in&nbsp;the day, sailors would have to&nbsp;accept living in&nbsp;such conditions, whether they were working for a&nbsp;big name like Christopher Columbus or&nbsp;not. The Niña and the Pinta were two of&nbsp;Columbus’ ships and the best sailing vessels of&nbsp;their time. Yet again, this didn’t change the fact that they were so&nbsp;small that men had no&nbsp;place to&nbsp;sleep.</p><p>Which gives&nbsp;us problem number three. Having to&nbsp;sleep next to&nbsp;one another on&nbsp;a&nbsp;crowded deck where they could barely move was not so&nbsp;great for sailors’ health conditions. And going below deck to&nbsp;escape the snoring of&nbsp;their fellow shipmates was not an&nbsp;option because there was no&nbsp;fresh air there. In&nbsp;addition, you could always come across a&nbsp;rat there. So, kiss personal hygiene goodbye. And in&nbsp;case you’re wondering how rats got there, those little rascals are actually good swimmers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/00c/8c4/98e07254a08424f44ea645e3ac.png><p>Also, sailors were at&nbsp;sea no&nbsp;matter the season or&nbsp;the weather, so&nbsp;they were often cold and wet, which also made it&nbsp;hard for them to&nbsp;stay healthy and strong. Speaking of&nbsp;health conditions brings&nbsp;us to&nbsp;problem number four. And it’s food and hunger. Sailors didn’t have their own mini fridges with different kinds of&nbsp;condiments back then, like the compartments luxury cruises have these days.</p><p>So&nbsp;they had to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with ways to&nbsp;store enough food that would last for months or&nbsp;even years. Due to&nbsp;that, their food options were limited. It&nbsp;definitely wasn’t anything like the food prepared by&nbsp;Michelin-star chefs. One of&nbsp;the most common food options on&nbsp;ships was salted meat which wasn’t as&nbsp;chewy as&nbsp;you imagine. Or&nbsp;a&nbsp;biscuit called “hardtack”&nbsp;— also called “sheet iron” or&nbsp;“worm castles.” And there’s a&nbsp;reason for all these creative nicknames.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8e4/17f/9f3bd7559996d80f65923515a0.png><p>Hardtack was essentially a&nbsp;mix of&nbsp;water and flour baked into a&nbsp;cardboard-flavored cracker. They were brick-like and the only way they could be&nbsp;eaten was if&nbsp;they were softened with water. If&nbsp;only sailors could dip them in&nbsp;their afternoon tea, right? Sometimes, these sea biscuits would still be&nbsp;extremely dense. Then sailors would have to&nbsp;slam their fists down on&nbsp;them to&nbsp;break them into smaller pieces to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;eat the stuff.</p><p>As&nbsp;long as&nbsp;hardtack was kept dry, it&nbsp;rarely got spoiled. The sailors would still be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;eat them after a&nbsp;year if&nbsp;they had any left. But most of&nbsp;the time, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;extremely hard to&nbsp;keep them dry inside wooden casks. And then, they would get infested with bugs that would leave small holes behind them. However, sailors would still eat them anyway. Have to&nbsp;take protein from somewhere!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd4/172/cec29051209c757d7599ad3573.jpg><p>By&nbsp;now, you might have figured out that there were no&nbsp;<a href=# title=fruits data-link=tag>fruits</a> or&nbsp;vegetables in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sailor’s diet. This caused vitamin deficiency in&nbsp;many sailors. So&nbsp;those toothless pirates and sailors in&nbsp;the movies you see? Yep! It’s all because of&nbsp;poor nutrition. And the iron-hard crackers probably didn’t help either.</p><p>But when sailors ran out of&nbsp;food, not having a&nbsp;balanced diet was probably the least of&nbsp;their concerns. Back in&nbsp;the old times, a&nbsp;voyage could take way longer than expected due to&nbsp;weather conditions&nbsp;— there could be&nbsp;no&nbsp;winds to&nbsp;push the ship further. Or&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful storm could shake the ship, and the waves and the water could destroy the food storage. So&nbsp;when such situations happened, sailors could easily run out of&nbsp;food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c96/9a5/b238bf55d39ede6446ce969372.png><p>Well, they could throw the net into the ocean and catch some <a href=# title=fish data-link=tag>fish</a>, right? But sailors didn’t eat fish even in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;starvation. Many captains mentioned this in&nbsp;their logbooks, which were basically captains’ diaries. The problem was not that sailors couldn’t get fish. In&nbsp;fact, many different kinds of&nbsp;fish were caught in&nbsp;their nets. But they had to&nbsp;throw them all back into the sea.</p><p>During the exploration era, Antonio Pigafetta mentioned in&nbsp;his logbook that his ship’s crew caught an&nbsp;unbelievable amount of&nbsp;fish, but they didn’t eat any of&nbsp;them. Also, in&nbsp;the same journal, he&nbsp;mentioned that 40&nbsp;of&nbsp;the sailors lost their lives. Naturally, sailors thought that only poisonous fish were dangerous. And because of&nbsp;that, they were inclined to&nbsp;eat only the fish they knew. But even a&nbsp;well-cooked tuna could be&nbsp;poisonous. And they had to&nbsp;learn it&nbsp;the hard way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bc9/14b/47e173558d8c9f5a7e7b854c72.png><p>But it’s not like they didn’t have any methods to&nbsp;check fish. Spanish sailors, for example, put silver coins on&nbsp;them. If&nbsp;the silver changed color, they considered those fish to&nbsp;be&nbsp;poisonous, therefore, inedible. So&nbsp;they would toss them overboard. Other sailors would place the fish they caught on&nbsp;the deck and observe if&nbsp;flies or&nbsp;other insects came to&nbsp;feast on&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;they didn’t land on&nbsp;the fish, then this meant that it&nbsp;was poisonous. But if&nbsp;insects did come, they considered it&nbsp;safe to&nbsp;eat.</p><p>The problem of&nbsp;eating fish caught in&nbsp;the open sea dates back to&nbsp;as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;the 7th century BCE. Imperial healers in&nbsp;ancient China knew that eating fish was the reason why some sailors lost their lives, but they couldn’t prove that the fish were poisonous. And the mystery remained unsolved up&nbsp;until the 19th century. In&nbsp;1886, a&nbsp;Cuban doctor finally figured out that some fish contained poison in&nbsp;their tissues and muscles&nbsp;— even though they were considered a&nbsp;safe-to-eat breed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa6/c46/f5ac5652d8bfc3f610c8528975.jpg><p>That kind of&nbsp;poison is&nbsp;actually something that is&nbsp;found in&nbsp;plankton. Some fish can eat this plankton without being affected. They store it&nbsp;inside their bodies. And as&nbsp;they grow, the rate of&nbsp;the poison increases with them. And this is&nbsp;something that doesn’t go&nbsp;away no&nbsp;matter how long one cooks the fish.</p><p>If&nbsp;you still think that life at&nbsp;sea back in&nbsp;the old days sounds exciting, this fifth problem will convince you otherwise. Let’s say you have managed to&nbsp;get along with your roommates, stay clean and healthy, and eat regularly. But there’s always the risk of&nbsp;getting caught by&nbsp;pirates. And they didn’t ask for things kindly.</p><p>So, if&nbsp;you didn’t want to&nbsp;end up&nbsp;as&nbsp;food for sharks, you would have to&nbsp;raise the white flag and simply join them. Not the career you were planning, right? Good luck scrubbing the deck for the rest of&nbsp;your life!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYysmKKkn6fAbr%2FTmqmvnZRiv6LAx56pZqyYlrtuscCtZJ%2Bho516eX2ScGpuZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
