Much of&nbsp;the films’ themes are based on&nbsp;the fact that relying on&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a> is&nbsp;fundamental. Outside of&nbsp;the fantasy world we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;the big screen, the actors also have excellent partners in&nbsp;the real world with whom they share other types of&nbsp;adventures.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>selected 10&nbsp;love stories of&nbsp;actors that portrayed some of&nbsp;the most beloved characters of&nbsp;the magical franchise that has captivated&nbsp;us in&nbsp;recent years.</p><p><h2>1. Eddie Redmayne (Newt Scamander) and Hannah Bagshawe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ad/385/c97e6059739e5c1f1bda815241.jpg><p>Many consider <a href=#>Eddie Redmayne</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only actor that could have ever portrayed Newt Scamander. Introduced in&nbsp;the second saga of&nbsp;the Harry Potter universe, Redmayne managed to&nbsp;capture the hearts of&nbsp;many women. Unfortunately for his fans, this talented actor had already found his other half. On&nbsp;December&nbsp;15, 2014, <a href=#>Hannah Bagshawe</a> and Redmayne decided to&nbsp;get <a href=#>married</a> after being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship for several years. They have 2&nbsp;children: Iris Mary Redmayne (<a href=#>born</a> in&nbsp;2016) and Luke Richard Bagshawe (<a href=#>born</a> in&nbsp;2018). Bagshawe is&nbsp;Redmayne’s faithful companion on&nbsp;each red carpet and the one in&nbsp;charge when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;<a href=#>helping</a> him choose all his clothes since the actor is&nbsp;colorblind.</p><p><h2>2. Warwick Davis (Professor Filius Flitwick and Griphook) and Samantha Davis</h2></p><p><a href=#>Warwick Davis</a> is&nbsp;the actor responsible for playing not just&nbsp;1, but 2&nbsp;characters in&nbsp;the Harry Potter franchise. His favorite <a href=#>line</a> from all the films is&nbsp;“wingardium leviosa” which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;spell that can elevate objects. In&nbsp;the movie, the wizard manages to&nbsp;raise a&nbsp;feather magically. In&nbsp;real life, what was raised was Warwick’s heartbeat the day he&nbsp;met his wife, <a href=#>Samantha Davis</a>. Their relationship <a href=#>began</a> during the filming of&nbsp;<a href=#>Willow</a> (1988) where Samantha Davis worked as&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra. They got married in&nbsp;1991 and had 4&nbsp;<a href=#>children</a>, although sadly, only 2&nbsp;survived to&nbsp;adulthood.</p><p><h2>3. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and Erin Darke</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3aa/828/83ef4055228e8e8451a1f0b86c.jpg><p><a href=#>Daniel Radcliffe</a> was still a&nbsp;kid when he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;portray Harry Potter. Since then, he&nbsp;has become a&nbsp;grown up&nbsp;and has even found love! Radcliffe’s “Ginny Weasley” is&nbsp;<a href=#>Erin Darke</a>, the actress famous for playing Cindy Reston on&nbsp;the show, <a href=#>Good Girls Revolt</a>. Both actors starred in&nbsp;the movie, Kill Your Darlings from 2013 which is&nbsp;where they first <a href=#>met</a> and they’ve been together ever since. Although rumors of&nbsp;an&nbsp;engagement have begun to&nbsp;spread, the actress’s father <a href=#>denies</a> the claims.</p><p><h2>4. Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) and Angela Jones</h2></p><p>The love story between <a href=#>Matthew Lewis</a> and <a href=#>Angela Jones</a> is&nbsp;among the most inspiring lucky coincidences in&nbsp;life. They both <a href=#>met</a> at&nbsp;the Harry Potter theme park in&nbsp;January 2016 where Jones was working as&nbsp;an&nbsp;event assistant. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the year, Lewis asked Jones to&nbsp;<a href=#>marry</a> him on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;Paris. 2&nbsp;years later, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;May 2018, the couple exchanged <a href=#>vows</a> in&nbsp;Italy. After that, they <a href=#>moved</a> to&nbsp;Los Angeles where they live today, sharing their house with 2&nbsp;<a href=#>dogs</a>.</p><p><h2>5. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Georgia Groome</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af6/491/777c3b59a08d92486f7c33ff84.jpg><p>For many, the news that <a href=#>Rupert Grint</a> hadn’t been single since 2011 was the biggest surprise of&nbsp;2018. The actor’s girlfriend is&nbsp;<a href=#>Georgia Groome</a>, an&nbsp;actress known for playing Georgia Nicolson, the lead role in&nbsp;<a href=#>Angus, </a><a href=#>Thongs</a>,<a href=#> and Perfect Snogging</a>. Fans <a href=#>found out</a> about the relationship from someone who tweeted that she had just realized the couple had been together for 7&nbsp;years<span>.</span> Needless to&nbsp;say, her tweet went viral.</p><p><h2>6. Zoë Kravitz (Leta Lestrange) and Karl Glusman</h2></p><p>For much of&nbsp;2018, Zoë Kravitz, who plays Leta Lestrange in&nbsp;the latest <a href=#>Fantastic Beasts</a> film, was silent about her love life until she confirmed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview with <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> that she had been engaged to&nbsp;actor <a href=#>Karl Glusman</a> since February 2018. The <a href=#>engagement</a> took place in&nbsp;<a href=#>Paris</a>. It&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;happen in&nbsp;the city but due to&nbsp;their busy schedules, Glusman ended up&nbsp;proposing at&nbsp;home. They were in&nbsp;sweatpants but it&nbsp;didn’t matter, she loved&nbsp;it! The relationship began in&nbsp;2016 when they were introduced by&nbsp;a&nbsp;mutual friend. They got married in&nbsp;2019.</p><p><h2>7. David Tennant (Barty Crouch&nbsp;Jr.) and Georgia Moffett</h2></p><p><a href=#>David Tennant</a> may have played a&nbsp;lonesome Death Eater in&nbsp;the Harry Potter films, but in&nbsp;real life, the actor isn’t lonely at&nbsp;all. His wife is&nbsp;actress, <a href=#>Georgia Moffett</a>. They met while filming the show <a href=#>Doctor Who</a> and on&nbsp;December&nbsp;30, 2011, the couple got married. They have 4&nbsp;children: Ty&nbsp;(Georgia’s son <a href=#>adopted</a> by&nbsp;Tennant in&nbsp;2011), Olive (<a href=#>born</a> on&nbsp;March&nbsp;29, 2011), Wilfred (born on&nbsp;May&nbsp;2, 2013) and Doris, whose birth the couple <a href=#>announced</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview on&nbsp;November 2015.</p><p><h2>8. Afshan Azad (Padma Patil) and Nabil Kazi</h2></p><p><a href=#>Afshan Azad</a> played one of&nbsp;the Patil twins from the fourth Harry Potter movie. The most important scenes she played were those of&nbsp;the Christmas ball in&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Goblet of&nbsp;Fire, where she was accompanied by&nbsp;Ron Weasley. In&nbsp;real life, the man who asked for her hand in&nbsp;marriage was <a href=#>Nabil Kazi</a>. Azad <a href=#>married</a> Kazi on&nbsp;August&nbsp;19, 2018. Some actors and former cast members attended the ceremony, including <a href=#>Bonnie Wright</a> (who played Ginny Weasley) and <a href=#>Katie Leung</a> (who played Cho Chang).</p><p><h2>9. Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) and Gisèle Schmidt</h2></p><p>Sirius Black is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the Harry Potter franchise’s most beloved characters. The actor who portrayed Sirius on&nbsp;the big screen is&nbsp;<a href=#>Gary Oldman</a>. Oldman has been married for almost 2&nbsp;years to&nbsp;<a href=#>Gisèle Schmidt</a>, an&nbsp;art curator. However, this was not the actor’s first marriage. He&nbsp;has gone through 4&nbsp;divorces from actresses like <a href=#>Uma Thurman</a> and <a href=#>Lesley Manville</a>.</p><p><h2>10. Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) and Emma Hewitt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/773/0b0/2acd6c5d84a28eaa76b62e45cc.jpg><p>Unlike Gary Oldman, <a href=#>Jason Isaacs </a>has been together with only one woman: <a href=#>Emma Hewitt</a>, a&nbsp;documentary filmmaker from the BBC. The couple has been living together since 1988 and together they have 2&nbsp;daughters, 16-year-old Lily and 13-year-old Ruby. Although in&nbsp;the films his character is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the cruelest, in&nbsp;real life, the actor <a href=#>says</a> he’s the opposite of&nbsp;Lucius Malfoy.</p><p>What is&nbsp;your favorite character from the Harry Potter universe?
