Women (47%) are more likely than men (35%) to say the prospect of their own death frightens them.</p><p>Women aged 25-39 (56%) are the most likely to say they fear death, while this falls to a quarter (26%) among men aged 60+.</p><p>Our study also shows that half (51%) of Britons who regularly practice their religion say they are not afraid of death, compared to 38% who formally belong to a religion but don’t practice it and 42% who are not religious.</p><p>A third of Britons who say they are afraid of dying say that the thought of death has affected how they enjoy their life. For most (57%), however, it has not.</p><p>There is a notable generational split on this question: for Britons under 40, 38-40% say their fear of dying has affected their life, compared to 33% of those in their forties and fifties, and 21% of those over 60.</p><h3>Is fear of death irrational?</h3><p>Three-quarters (75%) of Britons think fearing death is rational.</p><p>For those who think fearing death is irrational (15%), the greatest percentage is among men who are 60 or older (20%).</p><h3>What frightens Britons more: their own death or that of a loved one?</h3><p>Not all worry about dying is the same. The vast majority of Britons say they are more worried about the death of someone they love (63%) than their own death (6%). A fifth (22%) say they fear both equally.</p><p>Women (66%) are likelier than men (60%) to say they have more concern about a loved one dying than they are about their own death.</p><p>Men aged 16-24 (11%) are four times more likely than women the same age (3%) to say they are more worried about their own death than that of a loved one.</p><h3>Would Britons lay down their life for another?</h3><p>Three quarters (76%) of Britons say there is someone for whom they would give their life in order to save theirs. More women (80%) than men (72%) say this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhrZ2iGdXnYqKygp6Zisaat06FkrKylmcZussSaqWacqZ67qA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
