The singer was recently caught spilling a drink down a women’s dress in a local bar on camera.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-morgan-wallen-pours-a-drink-down-a-woman-s-dress>Morgan Wallen Pours a Drink Down a Woman’s Dress</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wallen</a> sparked controversy after a video of him spilling a drink down a woman’s top in a Nashville bar surfaced online. The act, captured on video, was seen by many witnesses present at the bar that night. The now viral TikTok video has gained tons of outrage on the video streaming platform.</p><p>This past Friday night, The Voice alum found himself at a local bar in Nashville, where fans relentlessly took photos of him when he walked in. In one now-viral video, Wallen is greeting his fans when a blonde woman suddenly pulls him away from his buddies.</p><p>The woman’s name is not known at the moment, and it is unknown if she knew the country artist before. The singer looked frustrated as he pulled away from the woman’s hand. She then walks away from him and returns to a female companion. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wallen</a> approaches from behind, picks up a drink, and pours it down the woman’s top. She looks surprised and pushes him back slightly.</p><p>What prompted the singer’s questionable behavior and what kind of connection he had with the woman are still unknown. As of right now, neither has his team commented on the situation and the incident also left fans outraged.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Singer Previously Sparked Controversy After Saying the N-Word Two Years Ago</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a> alum has already made headlines for all the wrong reasons before. He experienced severe backlash in February 2021 as a result of being caught on tape using the N-word and other profanities. Following the uproar, his label chose to part ways with him, and many of his supporters and friends turned against him.</p><p>“I’m embarrassed and sorry I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back,” Wallen said. “There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the promise to do better didn’t last long. Clearly, the country singer has once again found himself at the mercy of the masses. Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that Wallen is reported to have not yet paid a large portion of the $500,000 he promised to provide to organizations that help the black community.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_CalyBevier_Noam-GalaiGetty-Images-220x150.jpg alt="‘AGT All-Stars’ Singer Caly Bevier Unpacks Meaning Of Her New Single “Be Alright”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecClrKZlnaS%2FqK3NZq6apJyau26zxK2qZpuRqrSpwIysp6KknJ67qHnAZpuroZ6geqW71qdkmmWnpLqiutJmm6udo6h8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
