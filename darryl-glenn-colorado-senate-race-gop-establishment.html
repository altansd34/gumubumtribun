Michael Bennet.</p><p>Senate Republican leaders instead&nbsp;appear to be&nbsp;focusing the party’s energy&nbsp;on helping incumbent Republicans keep&nbsp;their seats in a year made uncertain by Donald Trump’s rise to the top of the ticket.</p><p>A spokesman for the&nbsp;Senate Leadership&nbsp;Fund, which is helping Republicans defend their majority, declined to comment about&nbsp;whether the&nbsp;organization&nbsp;would get involved in the Colorado race. Similarly, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) has been mum since Glenn’s win, despite previously declaring support for&nbsp;other candidates who emerged from competitive Republican&nbsp;primaries.</p><p>“If the GOP establishment wants to forfeit a race in a swing state and preemptively surrender the seat to the Democrats, that’s their decision. But no Republican in America should ever give them money again,” said&nbsp;Ken Cuccinelli, the president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, in an email to Morning Consult.</p><p>A spokesman for his&nbsp;group said it was actively raising money for Glenn, and hoped&nbsp;to raise $100,000 by the end of the second quarter Thursday evening.</p><p>The SCF, which is more in line with Republicans who buck party leaders such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee, endorsed Glenn early in the race. Party leaders, meanwhile,&nbsp;backed&nbsp;former state Rep. Jon Keyser, a young veteran with a scant voting record from his one year in the Colorado state House.</p><p>Contrary to party leaders’ hopes, Keyser tanked. He struggled to even keep his name&nbsp;on the ballot and was damaged by attacks from his four&nbsp;Republican rivals in the primary, their flame fanned by Democrats, who were not eager&nbsp;to face a candidate&nbsp;viewed as a commendable up-and-comer.</p><p>Unlike Keyser,&nbsp;Cuccinelli said the story of Glenn is one of an unlikely winner. He was “outspent 10 to one by two other candidates” and&nbsp;“won 70 percent at the state convention.” That, he said, makes him “very excited” about Glenn’s chances against Bennet.</p><p>The NRSC, which was attacking Bennet before the primary, has not said a thing about the Colorado Senate race since Tuesday’s results were tallied.</p><p>“Everyone knows the D.C. establishment wanted a candidate who would salute to the party bosses, but their candidate imploded and finished in fourth place,” he said, referring to Keyser’s <a href=#>showing in the primary</a>. “So if they aren’t happy with Darryl Glenn as the party’s nominee, they only have themselves to blame.”</p><p>A Senate Republican aide said Thursday that it is&nbsp;unlikely the NRSC will&nbsp;spend on the Colorado race right now. “The SCF got him through the primary and they should commit to spending in the general,” the aide said.</p><p>The Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, referred&nbsp;to Glenn as the GOP’s&nbsp;“nightmare-scenario candidate” as the results were finalized Tuesday night. Rick Palacio, the chairman of the&nbsp;Colorado Democratic Party, declared Bennet “the real winner” of the&nbsp;Republican primary.</p><p>“Republicans just nominated a candidate who says Donald Trump is a ‘patriot,’ thinks Ted Cruz should be the next Supreme Court justice, and believes the real problem with Washington is that there is too much bipartisanship between Republicans and Democrats,” he said.</p><p>Colorado is one of two seats that has been&nbsp;viewed as a realistic&nbsp;pick-up opportunity for Republicans. According to the<a href=#> Morning Consult Political Index</a>, Bennet&nbsp;ranks 84th in the Senate in terms of popularity, with an approval rating of 45 percent.</p><p>The other opportunity for Republicans to pick up a Senate seat is in Nevada, where Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid’s decision to retire created&nbsp;a tossup race between Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who used to be the state’s attorney general, and Rep. Joe Heck, a relatively well-polished Republican lawmaker who has won election in swing races before.</p><p>Unlike Colorado, the Senate Leadership Fund has poured money into the Silver State. On Tuesday, the <a href=#>group announced</a> it would spend $6 million on Heck’s behalf in September and October.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hha3xxgo5sZ2ickae%2FuriMoKOepp5isLC4zquYnaddqLKvrdOeZKuZk5p6qLvPZpysrJGXuaq%2Fx6acp6xf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
