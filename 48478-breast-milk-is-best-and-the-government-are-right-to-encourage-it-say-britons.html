Three quarters of Britons (74%) say that it is better for babies to given breast milk rather than formula milk, including 59% who think it is “much better”.</p><p data-block-key=7tera>One in eight (13%) think they are about equally good, while a statistical 0% say formula milk is superior.</p><p data-block-key=a4cmb>The same number of men and women think breast is best, although women are somewhat more likely than men to think neither is significantly better than the other (17% vs 8%), offset by men being more likely to answer “don’t know” (17% vs 11%).</p><p data-block-key=felkd>These figures are also all virtually identical to <a href=#>a previous YouGov survey in 2011</a>.</p><p data-block-key=b30vt>Mothers are especially likely to say breast milk is better than formula, at 78%. More recent mothers – that is to say, those who have at least one child who is under the age of 18 – are more likely to consider breast and formula milk to be equally good, at 23% compared to 14% of mothers whose children are now all over the age of 18.</p><p data-block-key=2npms>Breastfeeding is similarly favoured to bottle feeding, with 69% of people considering it the better option – including 70% of men and 73% of women. One in six Britons (17%) consider both equally good, with women again more likely than men to say so (22% vs 10%), and a statistical 0% again say bottle is better.</p><p data-block-key=1crg5>Mothers are again the most likely to think that breast is better than bottle (75%), although the same caveat is present as in the previous example.</p><h3 data-block-key=2b40q id=britons-say-that-it-is-right-for-the-government-to-encourage-breast-milk-over-formula-milk>Britons say that it is right for the government to encourage breast milk over formula milk</h3><p data-block-key=9olm8>Campaigners including supermarket groups are <a href=#>currently calling on the government to update legislation</a> which prohibits supermarkets from advertising cuts to the price of formula milk. Current rules ban retailers from advertising discounts on infant formula milk – and other forms of special offers – for fear that it would discourage breastfeeding. Such promotions are allowed for follow-on formula i.e. for babies over the age of six months.</p><p data-block-key=d2dv5>While the majority of Britons say that the government is right to encourage parents to use breast milk over formula (58%), most people also think the government is wrong to put such restrictions on the sale of formula milk (58%, rising to 68% of mothers).</p><p data-block-key=di3l3>Few agree with the government’s view, with only 19% thinking that promotions on formula milk would serve to discourage breast milk. Fully 53% say it wouldn’t discourage it very much or at all, rising to 62% among women and 68% among mothers.</p><p data-block-key=9d5o8>Government rules on formula milk were put in place because of unethical marketing practices by manufacturers in years gone by. It is not clear that the rules are now outdated: a 2023 study published in The Lancet medical journal described marketing strategies of formula manufacturers as <a href=#>predatory and exploitative</a>.</p><p data-block-key=di23b>The results show that the public tend not to trust that manufacturers will behave ethically (45%). A more optimistic 28% do have trust (although only 4% “a great deal” of trust).</p><p data-block-key=de3rb>Women in this regard are noticeably more trusting than men, at 33% to 23%, and mothers in particular (38%).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsaGmEeXnBq5yaq6Riuqq4ymagrGWSmsC1ecCnm2asmJp6qLvVnqmnpZWjwW6t0Z5kq6GXncFuwM5mnKebn6q%2ForPEZqCtZaOWxm6u0aKrqKaj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
