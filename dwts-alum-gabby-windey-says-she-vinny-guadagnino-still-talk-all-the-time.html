Admitting that the former Jersey Shore star is hot, it seems that their potential romance is still nowhere near a reality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gabby Windey Says She Doesn’t Know What’s Between Her and Vinny Guadagnino</h2><p>Speaking to Kaitlyn Bristowe’s Off The Vine podcast, Windey shared that things now appear vague with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guadagnino</a>. Apparently, while the two have been communicating consistently and having fun together, a label is still not existing at the moment.</p><p>“It was like kind of a thing and then, now I … I don’t know,” she said. “We’re still talking. We came on tour for like, a week and we had a ton of fun together. And he is just a good friend. He gets it, you know? Like, he spent his life on reality TV. He’s really smart. He’s really funny. He’s hot.”</p><p>The Bachelorette star went on and stated that Guadagnino used to slide into her DMs but have now gotten over that phase. Nonetheless, as she said, she once asked fellow DWTS alum if he’s flirting with her, to which he responded yes.</p><p>“I’m like, ‘Are you flirting with me?’ And he’s like, ‘Um, yeah. Now I’m nervous.’ And I was like, ‘Just tell me you like me.’ And he was like, ‘I like you,'” she said.</p><p>For those who may not know, Windey entered <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> season 31 engaged with her Bachelorette final pick, Erich Schwer. However, in the middle of the season, she confirmed that she’s already broken up with him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Considers Him a Great Friend</h2><p>Back in November 2022, the Windey and Guadagnino sparked <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dating rumors </a>with their flirty exchanges on Instagram. However, while they later clarified that they were just joking, Windey stated in a quick interview during People’s Choice Awards 2022 they might actually have a chance at love.</p><p>Furthermore, during the same podcast episode, Windey stated she considers Guadagnino as a “great friend” despite their unclear situation. It seems though that she’s also cool with him just being a buddy.</p><p>“He’s like, a friend too, first, which is something that I just really want,” Windey said. “We were gossiping and sending voice memos the other day and like, this is fun!”</p><p>On the other hand, Windey has also been trying work it out with another DWTS member, Alan Bersten. Last month, the two went on a dinner date in Los Angeles after Bersten asked her out. According to an unknown source, their dates would hopefully blossom into something more.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_BelloSisters_GotTalentEspana-220x147.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Alumni Bello Sisters Snatch Golden Buzzer in ‘Got Talent All-Stars 2023’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWRocKuecaamZuxXay2r7DEsmSsmamoerS0xGatoqaernqowcCdmKCmmaO8br%2FToqOlZaSWuax5wKWjZqyYmnq1tcyeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
