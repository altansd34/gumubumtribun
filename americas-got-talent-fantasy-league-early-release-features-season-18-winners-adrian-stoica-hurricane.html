On Friday, January 5, the show released Adrian and Hurricane’s preliminary performance ahead of the second episode’s premiere on January 8.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-champions-adrian-and-hurricane-return-to-america-s-got-talent>Champions Adrian and Hurricane Return to America’s Got Talent</h2><p>Italian dog trainer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adrian and his furry friend Hurricane</a> have officially found their way back to the America’s Got Talent stage. The winning duo is currently representing Team Simon on the spin off.</p><p>Within their early release performance, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">champions</a> are seen setting the scene of Adrian returning home to Hurricane. In a playful, yet reminiscent nod to their America’s Got Talent audition, the pair is seen preparing Adrian for bed after a long day.</p><p>The beginning of the video features the dog trainer walking onto stage with a bag, jacket, and hat. He them proceeds to take the TV remote from his dog, then reprimand Hurricane for watching the TV and sitting on the couch. From there, Adrian takes out a donut, which Hurricane quickly deters him from eating, due to his weight. Instead, Adrian begins doing squats with Hurricane. Hurricane eventually puts Adrian to bed, grabs the donut from the table, then returns to her chair.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In typical Adrian and Hurricane style, this performance tells a story as much as it shows off the duo. Adrian’s coaching and Hurricane’s attention to detail once again make their performance worth watching.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-judges-loved-this-performance>The Judges Loved This Performance</h2><p>After watching Adrian and Hurricane, the America’s Got Talent Fantasy League judging panel (comprised of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel, and Mel B) was giving the pair a standing ovation. All of the judges once again commented on how this is an incredibly unique dog act. The pair’s Team leader, Cowell, was clearly filled with pride of them as he gave his comments.</p><p>“Since the day we’ve met you you have just got better and better and better and I really think the fact that you put your title on the line to come back to compete again says so much about you as well,” he said. “I really really hope the audience votes you through.”</p><p>Following his comments, Cowell walked on stage to greet both Adrian and Hurricane. Before the judge went back to his seat, Adrian pulled him aside, and whispered that he has a crush on Mel B. Cowell, of course put the secret into action. He got the attention of the audience and told everyone that Adrian has a big crush on Mel B. The early released clip ends with Adrian taking a photo with Mel B.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_Paramore_ABC_Randy-Holmes-220x147.jpg alt="Paramore Cancels Performance After Deleting Social Media Posts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Adrian and Hurricane</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>america's got talent fantasy league</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlsBus86tZK2ZnJq7tXnFmqWtmaOueq2xwKCsnmWVlr%2BtxYyrnKWdkaiybrLEmquuqpWoerSxwKymp2VhbXq4tc2nnKurXZaxs7XAp2SsrJ%2BesKJ5x66pq6GTlrumew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
