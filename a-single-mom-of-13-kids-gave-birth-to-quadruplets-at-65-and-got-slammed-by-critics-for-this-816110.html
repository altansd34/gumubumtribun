However, people have divided between admiration for her resilience and bewilderment regarding how she would manage to&nbsp;raise the children at&nbsp;her advanced age.</p><p><h2>Annerget has 17&nbsp;children at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;65.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/016/927/1f534a5325b3452ff88f22b86e.jpg><p>A&nbsp;65-year-old German woman has successfully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>delivered</a> quadruplets through artificial insemination. Annegret Raunigk gave birth to&nbsp;three boys and a&nbsp;girl via Caesarean section.</p><p>Notably, Annegret Raunigk, who already had 13&nbsp;children and seven grandchildren, now holds the distinction of&nbsp;being the world’s oldest woman to&nbsp;have given birth to&nbsp;quadruplets. Her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a> first garnered significant attention when the press revealed the extraordinary news of&nbsp;her quadruple <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a>. At&nbsp;that time, she mentioned that her decision to&nbsp;have another child was influenced by&nbsp;her youngest daughter’s desire for a&nbsp;little brother or&nbsp;sister, who was nine years old.</p><p><h2>She was shocked to&nbsp;know she was pregnant with quadruplets.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c10/960/24a99e5ed48374946ab326bce0.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Raunigk</a>, whose oldest daughter is&nbsp;44, expressed her initial shock when doctors first informed her of&nbsp;the quadruplet pregnancy. However, she made it&nbsp;clear that she never considered reducing the number of&nbsp;embryos and faced the challenge with unwavering determination.</p><p>“I’m not actually afraid. I&nbsp;simply assume I’ll remain healthy and fit. In&nbsp;matters of&nbsp;organization&nbsp;I have enough experience, that’s not new for&nbsp;me,” she said. Notably, Raunigk had already made headlines a&nbsp;decade ago when she gave birth to&nbsp;her 13th child, Lelia, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;55.</p><p>She shared her perspective with reporters, saying, “At&nbsp;first, I&nbsp;only wanted one child. Not all were planned. But then things happen. I’m not a&nbsp;planner but rather spontaneous. And children keep me&nbsp;young.”</p><p><h2>People accused the woman of&nbsp;being irresponsible.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3a/5ef/fed7ae534fb0ebb649748b5253.jpg><p>Raunigk faced <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accusations</a> of&nbsp;acting irresponsibly due to&nbsp;the fact that she will be&nbsp;over 70&nbsp;years old when the quadruplets reach school age. Nevertheless, she has chosen to&nbsp;dismiss the <a href=# title=criticism data-link=tag>criticism</a>, asserting, “You can never know what will happen. Things can also happen to&nbsp;you when you’re 20. It’s up&nbsp;to&nbsp;each individual to&nbsp;decide when they become a&nbsp;parent.”</p><p>Throughout her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnancy</a>, she expressed the belief that everyone should have the <a href=# title=freedom data-link=tag>freedom</a> to&nbsp;lead the life they desire. When questioned about any concerns, Ms. Raunigk stated her confidence in&nbsp;maintaining her health and fitness, emphasizing that she was not preoccupied with the opinions of&nbsp;others.</p><p><h2>Not all clinics do&nbsp;IVF for older women due to&nbsp;social reasons.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a19/d72/00ef995efa87aef7fd970a5212.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Doctors</a> mention that not all clinics actually offer IVF treatment to&nbsp;women over the age of&nbsp;50, primarily for social reasons. “We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;consider the welfare of&nbsp;the child when making a&nbsp;decision,” a&nbsp;doctor says. It’s ultimately up&nbsp;to&nbsp;individual clinics to&nbsp;determine whether a&nbsp;woman, who at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;65&nbsp;might reasonably expect to&nbsp;live for another 20&nbsp;years or&nbsp;so, should be&nbsp;eligible for treatment.</p><p>“There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;regulation that says you can’t treat a&nbsp;woman older than a&nbsp;certain age. There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;upper age, but you will need to&nbsp;take into account the welfare of&nbsp;the child,” doctors add.</p><p>Although Annegret Raunigk is&nbsp;the world’s oldest woman to&nbsp;have given birth to&nbsp;quadruplets, she is&nbsp;not the oldest one to&nbsp;give birth. Another woman from <a href=# title=India data-link=tag>India</a> became a&nbsp;<a href=#>mom</a> at&nbsp;72&nbsp;despite doctors’ comments that she is&nbsp;too old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uv8innqWdXaK8rnnOn2Rqa12gtqW%2FjKCYr51dl7azwMdmq6hloaqupb7UqaOerKNirrV5lW5kmqaUYrSwwIyso5qlnZqxbq7YZpqroaSesLR5xaipZqyYnsBuhJBvaGpoXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
