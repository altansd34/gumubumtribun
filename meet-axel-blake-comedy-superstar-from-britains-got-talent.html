With his hilarious antics and easy-to-understand witty remarks, we’re yet to see his edge in the competition. Let’s get to know him more.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-axel-blake-owned-simon-cowell-s-golden-buzzer-won-britain-s-got-talent-season-15>Axel Blake Owned Simon Cowell’s Golden Buzzer, Won Britain’s Got Talent Season 15</h2><p>At the time of his audition in Britain’s Got Talent, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Axel Blake</a> does property maintenance as his day job. He primarily joined the competition to show his 12-year-old son that he can do anything if he believes in himself. As he went on to present an effortlessly funny comedy act, he didn’t only get the crowd’s approval, but Simon Cowell’s Golden buzzer as well.</p><p>“[You’re] the first person who has ever made a joke about Covid and was funny,” Cowell said.</p><p>Until the Finale, Blake never failed to give a stomach-curling routine, effectively delivering every single joke. His run in BGT season 15 was a well-deserved success, marking Cowell’s first Golden Buzzer act to ever win any Got Talent franchise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He’s Popular in the London Comedy Scene Even Before BGT</h2><p>Several people may not recognize his name, but Blake is already famous in the comedy circuit ahead of BGT. His journey in comedy started way back 2008, performing stand-up routines in London and engaging his fans in social media. According to his bio, his style is “truthful and observational,” built from personal encounters and years of experience.</p><p>Apparently, he’s played a comic role in a short film entitled Handle With Care in 2015. Furthermore, he starred in TV movie Pranksterz in a role that’s not revealed by his page in IMDB. In 2020, he was part of the cast of the film Love Spell and even portrayed himself in his Amazon Prime TV Special entitled Axel Blake – I’m Not Gonna Lie.</p><p>These appearances are not all of his milestones as he also did comedy shows including Comedy X-Factor, Comedy on the Hill and Young Dons of Comedy. However, while his talent has gained quite a traction before, Blake fully went mainstream after BGT.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Axel Blake Will Headline a 2023 Comedy Tour</h2><p>Blake’s successful run in BGT has paved the way for more opportunities. Upon finishing the show, he appeared in CBBC’s Saturday Mash Up Live, Celebrity Lingo, and Don’t Hate The Playaz.</p><p>At present, Blake is preparing to embark on his In Style Tour, kicking off from January 7 to May 7. With the comedy tour being simultaneous with his participation in AGT All-Stars, the first half of his 2023 is already jam-packed.</p><p>As one of the sought-after funnymen of his time, Axel Blake will attempt to prove that his antics do not only attract the UK crowd but the globe as well. To witness his journey in AGT All-Stars, be sure to tune in to the show on January 30 on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_MandyHarvey_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Pitch Perfect Deaf Singer Mandy Harvey to Perform on ‘AGT All-Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWRrbKtecGlmKSdXZi8rrHDsmSsraCav7TAwKtkn6qfonqjvsitmKKmo2K0sMCMrZilnZ6pfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
