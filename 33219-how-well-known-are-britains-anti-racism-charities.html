Stephen Lawrence was a black teenager murdered in a racist attack in 1993 – the Trust was founded by his mother Doreen in 1998 to tackle inequality and promote a positive community legacy in her son's name.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/best_known_anti_racism_charities_and_non_pr.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Football-focused charities Show Racism the Red Card (38% of all Britons vs 28% of Britons from BAME communities) and Kick It Out (34% vs 28%) are respectively the third and fifth most recognised organisations.</p><p>In both instances, men are more familiar with their work than women. Nearly twice as many men (45%) as women (23%) know of Kick It Out, while the gap is slightly smaller for Show Racism the Red Card, at 43% vs 34%.</p><p>Generally, most of the best known anti-racism charities score higher in terms of awareness with the general population than with Britons from BAME backgrounds.</p><p>The difference disappears for charities that less than a fifth of the public are familiar with. These have roughly the same level of awareness with both groups or are slightly better known by people from BAME communities.</p><p>The charity that BAME Britons are most likely to have heard of when compared to the general population is Stop Hate UK, which was founded to fight racial harassment in response to the murder of Stephen Lawrence. One in five BAME Britons (21%) are aware of their work, compared with only one in eight (13%) of the wider public.</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksqS7zaiksmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhrY2d%2BennHqK5mr5WhuW63zaiup2WRp7JurtGiq5qhnqh6orrTomSrmZOewK55wqGYq6GknrK0eQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
