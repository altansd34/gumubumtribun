YouGov’s latest research, conducted for BBC documentary Club 18-30, asks Britons what are the signs that youth is fading, and someone is on the fast track to being a grown up.</p><p>Overall, Britons are most likely to say that owning your own home is a “very good” or “fairly good” indicator of being grown up (84%), followed by 78% who think having a full-time job is a good marker of being grown up, and a similar proportion of people (76%) who think moving out of the family home is as well.</p><p>A majority (70%) also think that shopping around for deals on your household bills is a good sign you are a grown up, while just shy of two thirds (65%) think that graduating university is also a marker of adulthood (however only 44% think that going to university means someone is grown up).</p><p>Around six in ten people tend to think that getting married (62%), knowing your credit score (62%), and meal planning (61%) also show you are a grown up.</p><p>While a large majority say that fiscal responsibilities such as home ownership and bills are good signs of being grown up, they are less likely think that having children is a good indicator of being grown up at 52%.</p><p>Among the indicators that fewer than half of Britons think are good markers for someone being a grown up are passing your driving test (47%) and getting excited about buying cleaning products (44%).</p><p>Getting excited over cleaning products as a marker of being grown up is more popular with people aged 34 and under, 57% of whom say this is a good marker of grown up compared to 41% of those 35 and over. Those aged 34 and under are also more likely to think that having strong opinions about the stacking of dishwashers is a good marker of age (39%, versus 30% of the 35-pluses).</p><p>By contrast, those 35 and over are more likely to think that talking about the weather is a good indicator for being grown up (32%) compared to those 34 and under (19%).</p><h3>What age did Britons first feel grown up?</h3><p>Many of these indicators can occur at any age, however, so YouGov also asked Britons at what age they felt started to feel like a grown up. Age 18 (11%) is the most common single answer, unsurprisingly as it is the age at which adulthood legally begins. While 7% first felt grown up at 21, it is slightly later in the early twenties (between 22 and 23) when over half of adults say they began to feel like a grown up.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/age20feeling20grown20up.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>However, some 13% of Britons feel they still have not grown up. This figure is highest among the young at 33% of the 18-24 year olds, as well as 19% of those aged between 25 and 34, and 16% of people aged between 35 and 49. Among 50-64 year olds, 7% report still not feeling like a grown up, as do a youthful 5% of those 65 and over.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhrZGmCdXnSop6nq12ks26uxKKloGWXp7y4uoyupw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
