Here’s everything we know about them so far.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MWFuBBYpmc</p>Donut performs “Hooked on a Feeling” by Blue Swede on The Masked Singer One Hit Wonders Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 10</h2><p>Before the season premiere, the only clue we got was a short video of the celebrity under the mask on <a href=# class=broken_link>Instagram</a>. With such a quick clip and baggy clothes, it’s difficult to get any hints from that at all! Then on One Hit Wonders Night, the clues really rolled in.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO’S PERFORMING ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 10 PREMIERE?</a></strong></p><p>Donut’s clues started by saying he was part of a “mega-hit that catapulted [him] to #1.” But it also put him in a box, making people associate him with a “rough and tough flavor.” At this point, the Donut is walking through a Western town and we see a sheriff badge close up. He’s actually “well-rounded” though, he claims while a flag with “LA” on it flies next to him.</p><p>We then see the Donut in a city scene with a bunch of neon lights and digital billboards. He talks about being a “connoisseur of the theatre, from Chicago to 42nd Street.” The camera pans over to neon cowboy boots. Donut has been known to “pour his heart into a song…or two!” After the toughest year of his life, he needs to get back to his roots. We see a bow and arrow pointing at the moon to close his clues.</p><p>After the Donut’s performance, the Men in Black dance to “How Bizarre.” Donut then questions being on One Hit Wonder Night, claiming “just like Rocky,” he’s got “hit after hit after hit.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Donut</h2><p>Based on the clues, Jenny McCarthy thought this could be Sylvester Stallone, and Robin mentioned he also sang in a movie. Ken went with Jeff Bridges for his prediction, mentioning some of his clues that point to his roles. But then we went back to Jenny and she guessed this is “the legendary Tom Jones,” which Robin agreed with based on his vibrato. The most popular guess online is also Tom Jones!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Donut on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>All that being said, it’s time to make our prediction! And the celebrity under the Donut mask is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-john-schneider>John Schneider!</h3><p>First of all, the judges mentioned how tall the Donut is and John Schneider is 6’3″. There are many clues pointing to his country music career and most famous role as Bo Duke on The Dukes of Hazard, including the cowboy boots, sheriff badge, Western town, and the bow and arrow. He also mentioned a “mega-hit” early in his career and that could also be pointing to the show or his first of four #1 hits, “I’ve Been Around Enough to Know.”</p><p>The “LA” flag definitely makes sense for John Schneider, because was was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. He also directly shouted out two musicals that he’s been in in the clues, Chicago and 42nd Street, which seems oddly specific for him. The neon lights and digital billboards in his clues could also be pointing to the fact that he was born in New York, or that he was signed to MCA Nashville and that is meant to be reminiscent of Broadway in Nashville.</p><p>Finally, the Donut mentioned that he has had the toughest year of his life. That rings true for John Schneider, because his wife passed away recently.</p><p>So do you agree?
