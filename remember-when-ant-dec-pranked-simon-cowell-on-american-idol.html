The hilarious stunt happened on their talk show Saturday Night Takeaway all the way back in 2003.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ant-amp-dec-pranked-simon-cowell-on-american-idol>Ant & Dec Pranked Simon Cowell on American Idol</h2><p>Cowell appeared as a guest on Saturday Night Takeaway to talk about the success of American Idol. During his appearance, Ant & Dec played a clip from when they visited the United States to play a prank on Cowell.</p><p>The pair wore disguises and called themselves Scotty and Jimmy. For their audition, they chose to sing “Opposites Attract” by Cowell’s fellow judge Paula Abdul. In their version, they changed the word “lovers” to “brothers.”</p><p>Cowell was visibly annoyed by their performance, while Abdul seemed to get a kick out of it. However, Cowell eventually figured out what was going on after he saw Donnelly break dance. That’s when they finally revealed their true identities.</p><p>When they removed their glasses, Cowell leaned back in his chair and laughed. The judge joked that they were going to Hollywood before giving them a hug. He said the prank was “brilliant.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIMON COWELL, LAUREN SILVERMAN SHARE HOW SON ERIC CHANGED THEIR LIVES</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-did-cowell-figure-it-out>How Did Cowell Figure It Out?</h2><p>While the audition played, Cowell could be seen laughing as he watched it back from the set of Saturday Night Takeaway. When the hosts asked when he figured out it was them, Cowell joked that he “knew instantly.”</p><p>“This was not an unusual audition in America. This was a good one,” Cowell said, earning laughs. “When you started singing, I was looking over to the producer to actually say, ‘He looks a bit like Ant, this guy.'”</p><p>But what ultimately gave it away was that the two of them tend to do “a funny dance routine,” and he recognized it when they started busting a move during the audition. The judge told them that it “was one of your better performances.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_AdamLambert_Jo-HaleRedferns-220x147.jpeg alt="Adam Lambert to Make Broadway Debut in ‘Cabaret’ This Fall" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570Z6knqWSmr9uw8eepWaZnql6pbHCZqermZ6gsqV50qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKimXZa6pr7InJinZZmZvK17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
