He performed “Blackbird” by the Beatles. Lionel Richie complimented his “wonderful raspy voice of light,” while Katy Perry nicknamed him “Chayce the Ace.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>GRAHAM DEFRANCO REPLACES ARTHUR GUNN DURING ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ FINALE</a></strong></p><p>Meanwhile, Bryan told Chayce that he wants to go bass fishing with him. He told Chayce that he’s earned it, adding, “Win or lose, we’re going fishing.”</p><p>Chayce shared that he was “broken” before joining the show, and thanked his family for pushing him to audition.

Before the finale, he returned to his hometown in Georgia to reunite with his family. His mother was in tears over the reunion. After Willie performed “A Change Is Gonna Come” by Sam Cooke, Perry was in tears as well.</p><p>“Seeing you with your mother just melted my heart,” Perry said through tears, while Bryan said the performance brought him joy.</p><p>Earlier in the show, Willie said that he lacked confidence when he first auditioned for the show, and he later contemplated quitting after his grandfather’s death. It’s amazing to see how far he’s come, and to watch him own the stage with confidence. Richie told Willie that watching him perform is a “religious experience.”</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-grace-kinstler-gives-celine-dion-a-run-for-her-money>Grace Kinstler Gives Celine Dion a Run for Her Money</h3><p>Before her first performance of the night, Grace Kinstler said she would love to follow in Kelly Clarkson’s footsteps, calling her “authentic.” The judges chose for her to sing “All By Myself” by Celine Dion. Grace blew them away by making the song her own and giving Dion a run for her money.</p><p>Perry told Grace that the performance gave her “full body chills,” praising Grace’s “vulnerable power.” Bryan said she took the song “to another level,” while Richie told her, “Only you can create another song out of a standard song.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Grace didn’t make it into the Top 2. She was eliminated part of the way through the night, but there’s no doubt she has an incredible future ahead of her even without winning the show. Later in the night, she delivered another stellar performance of “Scars to Your Beautiful” with Alessia Cara herself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katy-perry-plays-guitar-during-performance-with-hunter-metts>Katy Perry Plays Guitar During Performance with Hunter Metts</h3><p>Judge Katy Perry delivered a memorable performance during the finale.

And as much as we totally love that persona, it was refreshing to see the judges show off her guitar skills and really showcase what an amazing voice she has.
