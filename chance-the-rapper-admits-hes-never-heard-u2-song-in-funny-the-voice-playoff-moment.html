Although Blake Shelton is typically the celebrity coach saying “I’ve never heard that song” Chance The Rapper may have taken his place this season. In yet another funny moment, the new The Voice coach admitted that he didn’t know U2’s “With or Without You.”</strong></p><p>Last night, The Voice returned to NBC with their second round of The Playoffs. Although Teams Kelly and Niall took the stage, all the coaches were able to talk about each performance. Since other coach comments can be overlooked in this round, you may have missed this funny moment.</p><p>Near the beginning of Monday night’s episode, Ross Clayton let his kids pick his Playoff performance song. His three children picked “With or Without You” by U2 as his song, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Niall Horan</a> absolutely loved the pick. For those who may not know, Bono (the lead singer of U2) if one of Ireland’s biggest celebrities.</p><p>Ross absolutely slayed this performance. He did a great job of implementing slight changes into the song, to make it his own. Unfortunately, Ross will not be continuing into the next round of the competition. Instead, Horan chose Gina Miles and Ryley Tate Wilson as his Top 2 artists.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chance-the-rapper-admits-he-doesn-t-know-famous-u2-tune>Chance The Rapper Admits He Doesn’t Know Famous U2 Tune</h2><p>Various coaches were seen singing along to Ross’s performance, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chance The Rapper</a> wasn’t one of them. When coaches were able to give their input, he acknowledged that he was the only one that wasn’t familiar with the song.</p><p>“I don’t know that song at all,” Chance The Rapper admitted. “Y’all don’t all know that song, y’all are just doing that now.”</p><p>The comment made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly Clarkson</a> get out of her seat. In typical Clarkson style, she began jokingly whacking Chance The Rapper with her clipboard.</p><p>“I don’t know Keith Urban? Do I listen to Keith Urban?” Chance The Rapper said.</p><p>Clarkson interjected yelling “This is not Keith Urban!!!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Finally, Chance The Rapper looked down at his clipboard and read that the song was “With or Without You” by U2. Throughout this riff, cameras shifted to Shelton, who unsurprisingly was amused by the whole thing.</p><p>Once the riff was seemingly over, Chance The Rapper said that U2 should take the opportunity to work with Ross. Following these comments, Clarkson acknowledged that “it’s an incredible day” for Chance The Rapper, since it’s a “great song.”</p><p>“Is it super super famous?” Chance The Rapper replied. “It’s a great song, I’ll check out this new group U2.”</p><p>The Voice returns to NBC on Monday, May 15 with the show’s first Live Playoff episode. Unlike previous seasons, this episode will feature live voting, and top contestants will be announced at the end of the night.
