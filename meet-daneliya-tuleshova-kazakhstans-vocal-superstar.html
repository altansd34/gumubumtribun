Let’s get to know her more.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daneliya-tuleshova-is-no-stranger-to-singing-contests-even-before-agt>Daneliya Tuleshova is No Stranger to Singing Contests Even Before AGT</h2><p>Hailing from Astana, Kazakhstan, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daneliya Tuleshova</a> was 14 years old when she auditioned in AGT season 15. She fascinated the crowd with her voice with her unbelievably clear vocals, proving that her singing talent knows no age. With this impressive act, it’s not surprising to know that AGT is not her first competition.</p><p>For those who may not know, she competed in and won The Voice Kids Ukraine back in 2017. This achievement marked her as the first ever non-Ukrainian to win the competition. Furthermore, Tuleshova was Kazakhstan’s first ever participant in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Junior Eurovision Song Contest</a> 2018 in Belarus, finishing sixth place overall.</p><p>Apart from these contests, Tuleshova also fought for a spot during the lone season of The World’s Best. She placed top 8 in the said series. Thus, by the time she joined AGT in 2020, Tuleshova was already accustomed to the crowd, making her stage presence all the more impactful.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She is a Total Performer, a Proud Kazakhstani</h2><p>Tuleshova grew up as an active kid, trying out different talents during the early stages of her life. She began ballroom dancing when she was six, taking part in a number of championships in competitions. At the time, Tuleshova also trains in contemporary dance classes, alongside acting and singing workshops. While these talents were not left entirely unattended, Tuleshova eventually decided that she must focus on her vocals.</p><p>Today, she resides in Boston, Massachusetts. Yet, she’s a dreamer that never lets her origins take a backseat. Tuleshova is ultimately proud of her roots, aiming to bring pride to her hometown.</p><p>“I want people to know that Kazakhstan is an unbelievable, wonderful and hospitable country!” she said in an interview.</p><p>Ariana Grande, Faouzia, and Cardi B are two of her favorite icons, but Beyonce is her “queen” among all. In fact, she’s released Beyonce music covers, <a href=#>“Crazy In Love”</a> and <a href=#>“Pretty Hurts.</a>“</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Daneliya Tuleshova Returns for AGT All-Stars</h2><p>Currently, Tuleshova has over a million subscribers on YouTube and more than half a million followers on Instagram. This huge amount of following will perhaps help her gain massive support in America’s Got Talent spin-off series, AGT All-Stars.</p><p>“Sometimes, I’m really insecure, and I’m always not good enough for me, so the most important thing for all singers and people is to believe in themselves,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Be sure to tune into NBC on Monday, February 6 to witness her preliminary performance.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_XOMGPop_viaIG-220x147.jpg alt="JoJo Siwa’s Girl Group XOMG Pop Launches New Halloween Costumes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWUlrumuMiymGaspaGytLTOr5hmo5Gvrqy00q2Yp6tdq7ykrctmqq6olafAta3RaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
