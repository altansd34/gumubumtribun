Morocco beat Argentina in the opening fixture on Wednesday after a VAR review that happened after two hours. Crowd trouble forced the players back into the dressing room after <a href=#>Argentina thought they had equalised</a> in the 16th minute of extra time.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><i>Сheck out news that is picked exactly<strong> for YOU</strong> ➡️ find the <strong>“Recommended for you”</strong> block on the home page and enjoy!</i></p><p class=align-left>Yes, you read that right. 16th minute of extra time. One thing that has quickly become apparent in Paris is the ridiculous amounts of minutes added at the end of each half.</p><p class=align-left>The Morocco vs Argentina game had 15 minutes added, Iraq vs Ukraine had 12 minutes, New Zealand's win over Guinea had 11 minutes, and so on.</p><p class=align-left>A day later, the script was the same for women's football, with 10 minutes added on for France's crazy game against Colombia.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/826b1de19d63e3c3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Paris 2024: Angry Argentina boss reacts as late goal was cancelled 2 hours after game ended</span></p></a><h2>What do football rules say about extra time?</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">IFAB Laws Section 7</a> dictates the criteria officials will use to determine the amount of time they will add at the end of half. Issues like substitutions, deliberate time wastage, medical stoppages and time used for celebrations are factored in.</p><p class=align-left>But as football fans have been accustomed to in the major European leagues, additional time often ranges from three to four to five minutes unless something serious happened in play.</p><h2>Why do Paris 2024 games have so much extra time?</h2><p class=align-left>Fans watching the Argentina vs. Morocco game were bamboozled by the extra time added, given that no significant incident occurred during the game. Well, the extra time was part of a new system FIFA is trialling out.</p><p class=align-left>Journalist Hugo Balassone, via <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bola Vip</a>, reports that FIFA is using a new VAR system that accounts for interruptions during the game and adds them at the end of the game to ensure 'greater net play time'.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/0637c23d3622d3c1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Paris 2024: Lionel Messi appears to slam controversial Argentina vs Morocco game</span></p></a><h3>How much time the ball is in play</h3><p class=align-left>It is reported that at the end of 90 minutes in the Argentina vs Morocco game, the ball was only in play for 54 minutes, which is way less than what FIFA wants. This is what is believed to necessitated the 15 minutes of extra time.</p><h2>World Cup 2022 and Paris 2024 comparisons</h2><p class=align-left>It is not the first time a FIFA competition has used this system. The 2022 <a href=#>World</a> Cup in Qatar also witnessed these bizarre amounts of minutes added on. Wout Weghorst famously equalised for the Netherlands against Lionel Messi's Argentina in the 11th minute of extra time.</p><p class=align-left>At that time, the head of FIFA referees, Pierluigi Collina, said that officials had been instructed to compensate for the minutes lost during a game.</p>"What we want to avoid is to have a match with 42, 43, 44, 45 minutes of active play. This is not acceptable," he said as quoted by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CNN</a>.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/0edad22de519a43a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Paris 2024: First proposal at Olympics as Argentine handball player engages hockey star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There you have it.
