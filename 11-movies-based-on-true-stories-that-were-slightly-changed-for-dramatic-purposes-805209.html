However, we&nbsp;must keep in&nbsp;mind that sometimes fiction surpasses reality. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;create more <a href=# title=drama data-link=tag>drama</a> or&nbsp;to&nbsp;make the plot more entertaining, many times what happens in&nbsp;the film is&nbsp;far removed from what happened in&nbsp;real life.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> found a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;films where the facts were changed or&nbsp;historical mistakes were made, although that did not prevent them from becoming big hits and leaving their mark on&nbsp;viewers.</p><p><h2>1. In&nbsp;<i>The Theory of&nbsp;Everything</i>, Stephen Hawking’s love story was changed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a5/df8/ee06315d56b9865ad95222617f.jpg><p>This film tells the love story of&nbsp;astrophysicist Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the tough challenges they faced for 30&nbsp;years due to&nbsp;Stephen’s degenerative disease. In&nbsp;the film, <strong>Stephen and Jane meet at&nbsp;Cambridge University</strong> in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK, however, this is&nbsp;not correct.</p><p>Jane herself revealed that the 2&nbsp;actually crossed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paths</a> at&nbsp;St. Albans when she was in&nbsp;high school and, from there, their romance evolved. She also stated that the film doesn’t make allowances for the constant and exhausting trips abroad and how difficult it&nbsp;was for her to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;getting everything ready.</p><p><h2>2. The drivers’ rivalry in&nbsp;<i>Rush</i> was pushed to&nbsp;the limit.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7de/bc6/4d74e256778f6941affbf71ed7.jpg><p>The film depicts the lives of&nbsp;drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt, who competed for Formula 1&nbsp;championships during the 1970s. In&nbsp;the film, the rivalry and mutual dislike are taken to&nbsp;exaggerated levels, while in&nbsp;real life the <strong>drivers formed a&nbsp;solid and lasting friendship</strong>, and even shared a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>home</a>.</p><p><h2>3. There were several errors and altered historical facts in&nbsp;<i>Gladiator</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/acc/064/10c50954e78a5e7b953e79b064.jpg><p>The 2000 masterpiece that thrilled thousands of&nbsp;spectators had several oversights. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the scenes, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>printed paper leaflets</a> are handed out among the spectators of&nbsp;the Colosseum, something unthinkable for the time. Another error is&nbsp;that during the Roman Empire, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Colosseum</a> was known as&nbsp;the Flavian Amphitheater, and its current name was popularized from the Middle Ages onward.</p><p>But the biggest inaccuracy was the death of&nbsp;<strong>Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his complicated relationship with his son Commodus</strong>, played by&nbsp;Joaquin Phoenix. In&nbsp;real life, the Roman emperor died of&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural illness, accompanied by&nbsp;his son until his last day. Contrary to&nbsp;what the movie shows, Commodus had a&nbsp;very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>close</a> relationship with his father, and ruled the empire together with him.</p><p><h2>4. In&nbsp;<i>The Imitation Game</i> they changed the name of&nbsp;the machine.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a72/0fd/e749e45999a0e2b6e658e2dcc4.jpg><p>This film tells the story of&nbsp;the fascinating life of&nbsp;Alan Turing, the British scientist who managed to&nbsp;invent the machine that cracked German codes and thus was able to&nbsp;put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;the war. In&nbsp;the movie the <strong>machine was named “Christopher,”</strong> supposedly inspired by&nbsp;Turing’s teenage love for his partner Christopher Morcom, but this could not be&nbsp;further from the truth. The real-life name of&nbsp;the machine was “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Bomb</a>.”</p><p>As&nbsp;for Christopher, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;evidence that he&nbsp;shared Turing’s love, although they did share a&nbsp;very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>close friendship</a> and his demise deeply affected the scientist. Another fact that is&nbsp;not mentioned in&nbsp;the film is&nbsp;that Turing did not build the machine alone, but had the help of&nbsp;mathematician <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gordon Welchman</a>.</p><p><h2>5. William Wallace was not the real Braveheart.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/863/f80/b64a745000baef7dc158067a76.jpg><p>Although William Wallace, the iconic character played by&nbsp;Mel Gibson, <strong>did exist in&nbsp;real life</strong>, his historical relevance was exaggerated, and the loss of&nbsp;his wife was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>invented</a> to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;dramatic twist. The real-life nickname “Braveheart” was given to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>King Robert I&nbsp;of&nbsp;Scotland</a>, played in&nbsp;the film by&nbsp;actor Angus Macfadyen, and not to&nbsp;Wallace.</p><p><h2>6. <i>Django Unchained </i>was way ahead of&nbsp;its time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b3/dd4/1d6c2558c19d2d26ffb723fab5.jpg><p>Jamie Foxx undoubtedly left his mark on&nbsp;cinema by&nbsp;playing Django, and one of&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;will never forget is&nbsp;his unique style. During practically the entire movie, the character wears <strong>sunglasses</strong>, something that could not really have happened, since this accessory began to&nbsp;be&nbsp;popularly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worn</a> in&nbsp;the 1920s, at&nbsp;least 60&nbsp;years after the time in&nbsp;which the film is&nbsp;set.</p><p><h2>7. <i>Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean </i>had several wardrobe and location oversights.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95b/9e6/66180352cf914d0e9f59822a05.jpg><p>Thanks to&nbsp;its comic and adventurous touch the film was a&nbsp;worldwide success but, in&nbsp;reality, there were many logistical and wardrobe oversights. The film depicts <strong>Port Royal</strong> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;thriving city and a&nbsp;major British port in&nbsp;1720. But the truth is&nbsp;that the city was destroyed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;fatal earthquake in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1692</a>&nbsp;and, despite attempts, it&nbsp;was not possible to&nbsp;rebuild&nbsp;it.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, the uniforms used by&nbsp;the officers of&nbsp;the Royal Navy did not exist at&nbsp;the time in&nbsp;which the film is&nbsp;set. The first regulations <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began</a> in&nbsp;1748, imposed by&nbsp;Admiral George Anson.</p><p><h2>8. Queen Mary of&nbsp;Scots and her strange taste for piercings in&nbsp;<i>Mary Queen of&nbsp;Scots.</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/41b/f32/6366745c87b50b4e381dcb0a0c.jpg><p>During many scenes, we&nbsp;see Queen Mary Stuart with <strong>multiple earrings and ear piercings</strong>, much more modern accessories, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;unknown if&nbsp;they existed in&nbsp;the sixteenth century, the era in&nbsp;which the film is&nbsp;set.</p><p>Moreover, in&nbsp;no&nbsp;portrait or&nbsp;book can <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Queen Mary I&nbsp;of&nbsp;Scotland</a> be&nbsp;seen wearing the piercings shown in&nbsp;the film. What we&nbsp;cannot deny is&nbsp;that, in&nbsp;fiction, they give her an&nbsp;unequaled touch of&nbsp;strength and personality.</p><p><h2>9. Love was not what inspired Shakespeare to&nbsp;write <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db4/0af/f1093f5ef4aedc9caf087989a9.jpg><p>Very little is&nbsp;actually known about William Shakespeare’s personal life, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;completely natural that the romance described in&nbsp;<i>Shakespeare in&nbsp;Love</i> was fictional. What is&nbsp;quite inaccurate is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;inspired him to&nbsp;create his masterpiece<i>,</i> <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. In&nbsp;reality<i>,</i> Shakespeare based it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;popular play that already existed written by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Luigi Da&nbsp;Porto</a>, an&nbsp;Italian writer.</p><p>It&nbsp;would also not be&nbsp;possible for <strong>the queen to&nbsp;travel to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;play at&nbsp;the time</strong>. The theater companies were the ones who traveled to&nbsp;perform before the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>court</a>.</p><p><h2>10. <i>Apollo 13&nbsp;</i>and the forgotten hero no&nbsp;one talks about</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/546/973/bcd87458febf34fb1eb5baf8d8.jpg><p>The movie shows&nbsp;us many confrontations and discussions between the astronauts and the other NASA collaborators, but in&nbsp;reality, this never happened. In&nbsp;addition, the solutions to&nbsp;the problems presented in&nbsp;the film <strong>were quite improvised in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;maintain the tension</strong>, but in&nbsp;real life, there were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>contingency</a> and crisis plans for any unforeseen event.</p><p>The film also forgot to&nbsp;mention a&nbsp;very important hero, thanks to&nbsp;whom the crew of&nbsp;Apollo 13&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;survive: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Glynn Lunney</a>, the engineer and flight director. His quick and wise decisions were one of&nbsp;the keys to&nbsp;the astronauts’ safe return home.</p><p><h2>11. <i>The Pursuit of&nbsp;Happiness </i>altered the actual sum of&nbsp;Chris’ salary.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0e/9fb/fa1d12559faf13638ddd5a31ca.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the film that tells the story of&nbsp;<strong>Chris Gardner’s struggle and subsequent overcoming of&nbsp;his circumstances</strong>, the protagonist agrees to&nbsp;do&nbsp;an&nbsp;internship at&nbsp;a&nbsp;brokerage firm without a&nbsp;salary. This was completely exaggerated to&nbsp;increase the drama of&nbsp;the film.</p><p>Chris actually got paid a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thousand dollars</a>, which, although not a&nbsp;huge amount for a&nbsp;father taking care of&nbsp;his son in&nbsp;San Francisco, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;far cry from what the movie led&nbsp;us to&nbsp;believe.</p><p>What are your favorite movies based on&nbsp;real events?
