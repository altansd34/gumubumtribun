The former Dancing With The Stars pro married Lancaster in Sundance, Utah in January 2017.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-louis-van-amstel-reveals-he-husband-josh-lancaster-are-officially-divorced>Louis Van Amstel Reveals He, Husband Josh Lancaster are Officially Divorced</h2><p>Amstel shared the shocking news in a video posted on Instagram. In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">candid</a> announcement, Amstel began by saying that his revelation will be “very weird” and “emotional.”</p><p>“I just felt the need to be transparent, not [a] hypocrite and kind of shine some light on why I have not posted. I can tell you that our little household has not been doing very well,” he said. “It has been a sh–show and it’s been really tough. Some tough decisions had to be made, then there’s the pressure of social media.”</p><p>The choreographer went on and stated that he felt the need to post as he’s still a public figure. According to Amstel, he also had to say the news “out loud” to himself so he could live by the fact that his separation from Lancaster is true.</p><p>“There’s no reason to put something positive to cover things up, so I won’t,” he said. “So if I’m in a bad place or my family is or, and I’m not talking about my divorce. Yes, I am divorced officially. We’re doing good. We’re working through this all.”</p><p>Ahead of the announcement, fans had been noticing that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amstel</a> hasn’t posted shared photos related to Lancaster. This has led them to ask about the status of their relationship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-estranged-couple-share-two-sons>The Estranged Couple Share Two Sons</h2><p>During his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce</a> announcement, Amstel stated that their divorce is affecting their loved ones. He particularly mentioned that one of his sons is “not doing well.”</p><p>“You know when your loved ones, the younger ones, my son is not doing well, it affects everyone. We’re getting through this. But it’s not easy,” he said. “I’m alive and we’re working through this, but I’m not even going to apologize if I’m not posting because when I have something really sincere to share, I will do it.”</p><p>Amstel and Lancaster shares two adopted sons, Daniel and Jonny, both of whom are teenagers. In his previous Instagram post, the DWTS pro shared that they keep the boys separate for they have different interests.</p><p>Nonetheless, in January, Amstel maintained that while Daniel and Jonny aren’t biological siblings, they are bonded brothers.</p><p>“They love each other, they fight with each other, they have each other’s backs, they throw each other under the bus,” he told People. “We took it one step at a time. We have weekly therapy sessions. Both boys love going to school too. The teachers love them.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_TaylorSwift_Taylor-HillTAS23Getty-Images-for-TAS-Rights-Management-220x147.jpeg alt="Everything to Know About ‘DWTS’ Taylor Swift Night Guest Judge Mandy Moore" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuuM6uoKxlppa7bq3MrKuepF2jrre1xpqrnqtdqLatsc2tZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMoqusZZKasq950Z6YpaSpYsGwwcahZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
