The Cereal Killer Café sells over 100 different types of cereal, but critics branded its bearded owners ‘<a href=#>out-of-touch</a>’ for selling cornflakes at £3.20 a bowl in close proximity to one of London’s poorest areas.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Trend.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>London has seen an explosion of hipsterdom over the last decade, with disadvantaged areas flocked to by young artists and musicians one after another. Working class areas like Peckham and Hackney have become central to new scenes, but YouGov research in the Capital finds one undisputed winner of trend.</p><p>Shoreditch is seen by 38% of Londoners as the trendiest area. Brixton, Dalston and Stoke Newington are next, on 15%, 12% and 12% respectively. New Cross and Camberwell, both home to arts colleges, are seen seen as the least trendy of the list provided, on 4% and 6% respectively.</p><p>Most Londoners (56%) say they neither like nor dislike the hipster inhabitants of these areas, but the generation largely occupied by this culture, 18-24 year-olds, are most likely to take un unfavourable view (29% compared to 15% of over-60s).</p><p>But while they may say they’re indifferent, the 64% of people who described a hipster had some clear impressions of what a hipster means to them.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/HipsterYG.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>‘Trendy’ is the most widely-reported word, with a count of 136. Next is ‘pretentious’ on 48 and ‘beard’ on 40. ‘Cool’ and ‘sheep’ also feature highly, on 25 and 21 respectively.</p><p><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWZ%2FcoCMoaCpq6Sav7Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
