We’ve all heard stories like that, and they never get old. Lately, there was this viral pic of&nbsp;an&nbsp;old couple in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a> bed, holding hands, and it&nbsp;really touched everyone. That’s because there’s an&nbsp;amazing <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a> behind that picture, and we’re going to&nbsp;dive into it&nbsp;today.</p><p><h2>They were high school sweethearts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59a/454/fca68d5eb3ba380ed371059abe.jpg><p>The love story of&nbsp;Virginia and Tommy was way more than just highlights; it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>heartwarming journey</a> scattered across the state of&nbsp;Tennessee.</p><p>Tommy Stevens&nbsp;Jr., or&nbsp;“Tommy” as&nbsp;everyone called him, entered into the world on&nbsp;a&nbsp;snowy Christmas Day in&nbsp;1931, right in&nbsp;Kingsport. Meanwhile, about 71&nbsp;miles down the road in&nbsp;Jefferson City, Virginia McKarem was born in&nbsp;March. Back then, they had no&nbsp;idea that their paths would ever cross.</p><p>Even though they were born miles apart, <a href=# title=fate data-link=tag>fate</a> had different plans. Virginia’s family moved to&nbsp;Kingsport, and that’s when the sparks started to&nbsp;fly. Their love story began at&nbsp;Dobyns-Bennett High School, and they quickly became each other’s childhood sweethearts. As&nbsp;time went&nbsp;on, their connection only deepened.</p><p><h2>Through thick and thin, but always together</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df4/36b/fd668a56fe8150635e7dd69fcc.jpg><p>After graduating from high school, they both headed to&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Tennessee in&nbsp;Knoxville, and in&nbsp;1954, they sealed the deal and tied the knot. Just like many other couples of&nbsp;their generation, Tommy joined the U.S. Army, and together, they embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey that took them to&nbsp;various places in&nbsp;the eastern United States. But no&nbsp;matter where life took them, Tennessee was always their true home.</p><p>After their military adventures, they settled down in&nbsp;Memphis, where they welcomed and raised their two kids, Greg and Karen. While living in&nbsp;Memphis, they decided to&nbsp;take the entrepreneurial plunge and founded Distribution and Transportation Services, Inc. (DTS). Over the years, DTS grew into a&nbsp;thriving family of&nbsp;transportation and logistics companies, serving the southeastern United States. Their love story, much like their business, was built on&nbsp;a&nbsp;solid foundation of&nbsp;dedication, hard work, and a&nbsp;bond that lasted a&nbsp;lifetime.</p><p><h2>The illness that brought them even closer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/588/ab5/0cdb0750768d8ce370146c2b82.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the years passed&nbsp;by, the children grew up&nbsp;and embarked on&nbsp;their own life journeys, and soon enough, the pitter-patter of&nbsp;grandkids filled the air. It&nbsp;was then that Tommy and Virginia decided that one more move was in&nbsp;order.</p><p>After an&nbsp;incredible half-century of&nbsp;business with DTS, the couple made the momentous decision to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>retire</a>. They packed their bags and settled in&nbsp;Franklin, just outside of&nbsp;Nashville, all in&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;being active participants in&nbsp;their grandkids’ lives. Their later years were a&nbsp;whirlwind of&nbsp;school activities, cheering at&nbsp;sporting events, family beach vacations, and simply cherish each other’s company. Life was a&nbsp;beautiful symphony.</p><p>However, as&nbsp;time went&nbsp;on, Tommy’s health took a&nbsp;turn for the worse. He&nbsp;was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and the once-vibrant man gradually began to&nbsp;slip away. Virginia, true to&nbsp;her unwavering commitment, stood by&nbsp;his side as&nbsp;always. Tommy’s health deteriorated further while he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the memory care unit, and he&nbsp;was swiftly transferred to&nbsp;Vanderbilt, where the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Medical Center’s Palliative Care Unit</a> became his final refuge as&nbsp;medical treatment lost its effectiveness.</p><p>Unfortunately, even Virginia found herself in&nbsp;the hospital, having taken a&nbsp;fall on&nbsp;the very morning Tommy was admitted. Her daughter recalled saying to&nbsp;her mom: “Really, we&nbsp;think that you just needed to&nbsp;check on&nbsp;Dad, and that was your ride.” As&nbsp;the family kept going back and forth between visiting Tommy in&nbsp;the Palliative Care Unit and Virginia in&nbsp;the Trauma ICU, the caring staff brought the couple together to&nbsp;make things easier.</p><p>First, they arranged for Virginia to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;room right next to&nbsp;Tommy’s. Then, they set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;bed right beside Tommy’s so&nbsp;that Virginia could be&nbsp;by&nbsp;his side, giving him comfort and reassurance. “You know, it&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot,” Virginia <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “It&nbsp;just gave me&nbsp;peace that&nbsp;I wouldn’t have to&nbsp;worry about him. He&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Until the very last moment</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3fe/ac2/65ec6c582a9329c88ade9e26d5.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the hospital staff members remembers the couple’s time there, highlighting how touching it&nbsp;was, even for them. “It&nbsp;reminds me&nbsp;of&nbsp;why we&nbsp;do&nbsp;this work,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a>. “We&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;people, husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, not patients. We&nbsp;brought this family together during one of&nbsp;their most difficult times, with little effort on&nbsp;our part. It&nbsp;involved a&nbsp;call, seeing an&nbsp;extra patient that day, and some conversations.”</p><p>“From the time we&nbsp;brought Mrs. Stevens over, she held her husband’s hand and fussed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very loving way with him,” she adds. “She could tell me&nbsp;Monday that she was at&nbsp;peace with what was going&nbsp;on, and she wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there until the end.”</p><p>A&nbsp;touching family photo captures Tommy, and Virginia holding hands in&nbsp;their hospital beds. These two lovebirds shared nearly 69&nbsp;years of&nbsp;their lives together. Their final days were spent in&nbsp;the hospital, side by&nbsp;side, holding onto each other.</p><p>Sadly, Tommy Stevens passed away on&nbsp;September&nbsp;8, just a&nbsp;day before what would have been their 69th anniversary. Nine days later, Virginia, also&nbsp;91, joined him. Although their last moments together were spent in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hospital bed, their days were still filled with smiles and the presence of&nbsp;family.</p><p>Karen Kreager, the couple’s daughter, shared that when her parents saw each other in&nbsp;the hospital, their faces lit up&nbsp;with joy. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claims</a>, “He&nbsp;was awake when she came&nbsp;in. His eyes were open. He&nbsp;wasn’t communicating a&nbsp;lot, just in&nbsp;small whispers. But he&nbsp;knew that she was there and that she was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;right beside him. <strong>They haven’t stopped holding hands the whole time. She won’t let go&nbsp;of&nbsp;him</strong>.”</p><p>Love knows no&nbsp;limits or&nbsp;boundaries, and celebrities like <a href=#>Liam Neeson</a> and his late wife have proven this with their inspiring love story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYympq%2Bhnpx6tMDOq7BmmpWdtq%2BwjJpkr6GilrluvMeoq6hln5t6orqMnqOdnaKhxm6vzq6npZ1dnbytsMinnmagkaOxtHnIp2StoJVitbC%2Fz6KrmqRdl7KleZdqbG9raGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
