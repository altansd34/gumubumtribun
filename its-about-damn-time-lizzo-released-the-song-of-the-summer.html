On April 15, the three-time Grammy Award winner dropped her newest single “About Damn Time” and announced the release of her third studio album.</strong></p><p>Lizzo is once again proving she has what it takes to top the charts with her good vibes and self love. The single “About Damn Time” talks about picking yourself up after a period of low self confidence. It tells the tale of Lizzo brushing her stresses off and saying she’s going to be alright.</p><p>“I’m way too fine to be this stressed, yeah / Oh, I’m not the girl I was or used to be, uh / B*tch, I might be better / Turn up the music, turn down the lights / I got a feelin’ I’m gon’ be alright,” she sings.</p><p>This superstar released a music video alongside the new single. The music video begins with Lizzo sitting in the “Stressed and Sexy support group.” The leader of the group picks on the singer to read her poem comparing something that makes her feel stressed to something that makes her feel sexy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The prompt leads Lizzo to run out of the room and begin the song elsewhere. In the beginning of the video, she’s seen rocking a groutfit, but she quickly changes into a blue sparkly bodysuit when she’s embracing her inner self.</p><p>The video features a disco vibe with multi-colored lights shining throughout the tune. Even though there’s limited choreography in this video, Lizzo still puts on a great show. Her self love radiates through the screen with this video. Everything about this new sound is working for Lizzo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lizzo-s-self-love-anthem-about-damn-time-breaks-into-itunes-top-10-in-less-than-24-hours>Lizzo’s Self Love Anthem “About Damn Time” Breaks into iTunes Top 10 in Less Than 24 Hours</h2><p>I truly believe Lizzo has released yet another song of the summer. Merely hours after the singles release it’s already broken into the top 10 of the iTunes chart. “About Damn Time” currently sits at No. 8 on the chart below “<a href=#>Bam Bam</a>” by Camila Cabello and Ed Sheeran. It’s only a matter of time until this song makes its way to No. 1.</p><p>“About Damn Time” is similar, yet different from the singers other music. While she always sticks to the self love narrative, this song isn’t related to anyone else’s opinion. Her biggest hits “Good As Hell” and “Truth Hurts” are about picking yourself up after a breakup. “About Damn Time” is clearly about picking yourself out of a rut of self deprecation. I love Lizzo’s other hits, but I’m absolutely obsessed with this narrative.</p><p>“About Damn Time” is the first single to release from Lizzo’s upcoming 12 track album, Special. <a href=#>The</a> upcoming album was written about her relationship with turning fear into love. She strives to empower fans with the upcoming release. Special by Lizzo releases on July 15, 2022 and is currently available for pre-order for $9.99 on iTunes.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NUP_197274_04745.jpg alt="Jonah Prill Represents Montana on ‘American Song Contest’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yK2qZpmSpMK1ecOapKdlpJ66pnnLorGzp12nsq2xwKycnWWknbJuv86nnmanlmLBqbGMrKympZWnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
