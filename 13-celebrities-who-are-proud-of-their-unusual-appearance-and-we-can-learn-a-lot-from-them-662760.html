But they manage to&nbsp;use their unusual appearances for their own benefit. There are no&nbsp;perfect people in&nbsp;the world, so&nbsp;why don’t we&nbsp;just accept each other for what we&nbsp;really are.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> has collected 13&nbsp;celebrities who don’t worry about their unusual appearance and easily demonstrate it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the entire world.</p><p><h2>Kate Hudson</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you have pointy ears and you worry about them, you should look to&nbsp;this <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> star as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example. <a href=# title="Kate Hudson" data-link=tag>Kate Hudson</a> doesn’t hide her ears in&nbsp;her hair, she does everything to&nbsp;highlight this special feature. Recently, the actress got a&nbsp;short haircut. Now she can easily show off her pointy ears to&nbsp;anyone.</p><p><h2>Natalie Dormer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c33/066/9fbb8c5e7496315032fdeddb5b.jpg><p>Natalie Dormer has facial nerve palsy which she got during birth. The damage is&nbsp;barely noticeable when the actress is&nbsp;smiling, but it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;seen when her face is&nbsp;relaxed. However, most viewers don’t notice it&nbsp;because experienced makeup artists can hide this imperfection.</p><p><h2>Joaquin Phoenix</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebf/76a/3f50e85183ac2663ce1ce4fd29.jpg><p>Joaquin Phoenix was born with a&nbsp;cleft lip. After surgery, he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;scar between his upper lip and nose. But this feature never stood in&nbsp;the way of&nbsp;Phoenix becoming one of&nbsp;the most successful Hollywood actors.</p><p><h2>Paris Hilton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ee/3c5/ac58b15208917eb7edd9809484.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;Paris Hilton’s photos from different events, you will probably notice that she usually faces the camera with the right side of&nbsp;her face. It’s because she has amblyopia, also known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lazy eye: because of&nbsp;weak muscles, one eye seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot smaller than the other one.</p><p><h2>Denzel Washington</h2></p><p>2-time Oscar winner Denzel Washington has something unusual about his appearance, too. When he&nbsp;was young, he&nbsp;was playing sports and broke the pinky on&nbsp;his right hand. He&nbsp;didn’t get medical help in&nbsp;time, so&nbsp;his pinky looks a&nbsp;little strange. But who cares about fingers when an&nbsp;actor is&nbsp;this talented?</p><p><h2>Jennifer Garner</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a8b/e02/6d9009500f9779213c9ca20112.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jennifer Garner" data-link=tag>Jennifer Garner</a>’s toes are a&nbsp;little deformed. On&nbsp;her right leg, the pinky toe lies on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the adjacent toe. In&nbsp;most cases, this anomaly appears because the person consistently wore shoes that were ill-fitting or&nbsp;too small. But the actress doesn’t care about this unusual thing and still wears sandals.</p><p><h2>Daryl Hannah</h2></p><p>Daryl Hannah doesn’t have a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her index finger on&nbsp;her left hand. She got this injury in&nbsp;an&nbsp;accident when she was a&nbsp;child. Daryl was visiting her grandmother and she stuck her finger in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the wall of&nbsp;the house. She couldn’t get it&nbsp;out, so&nbsp;urgent measures had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken.</p><p><h2>Forest Whitaker</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5dc/17f/0b87635f5a8eab23a19b7675d0.jpg><p>Forest Whitaker has eyelid ptosis, so&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his eyes always appears a&nbsp;little bit closed. This feature could be&nbsp;fixed with a&nbsp;surgery but the actor doesn’t want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it: his look is&nbsp;his thing now.</p><p><h2>Kylie Jenner</h2></p><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;5, <a href=# title="Kylie Jenner" data-link=tag>Kylie Jenner</a> pierced her leg with a&nbsp;metal rod in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fence when she was playing hide and seek with her sister. Now, she has a&nbsp;big scar on&nbsp;her left hip. But she is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;have surgery to&nbsp;get the scar removed, and she has no&nbsp;problem with wearing short dresses.</p><p><h2>Bill Nighy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e84/f1e/f531f15a22861383b91a1e7b3d.jpg><p>When Bill Nighy was 20&nbsp;years old, he&nbsp;was diagnosed with Dupuytren’s contracture. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;disease which leads to&nbsp;a&nbsp;partial loss of&nbsp;wrist function. So, the actor’s fingers, specifically the ring finger and the pinkies on&nbsp;both hands, are always pressed against his palms.</p><p><h2>Tina Fey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/54c/c17/e3cef555a7a8f65c4742547e18.jpg><p>When Tina Fey was 5&nbsp;years old, she was attacked. A&nbsp;man cut her face with a&nbsp;knife. Tina has had a&nbsp;scar on&nbsp;her face ever since then.</p><p><h2>Whoopi Goldberg</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30f/c8f/49e45b5a9d845d6875a307d8b1.jpg><p>Have you ever noticed anything unusual about Whoopi Goldberg’s appearance? She doesn’t have eyebrows! The actress shaved them off once and when they started to&nbsp;grow back, they itched a&nbsp;lot. So&nbsp;since then, Goldberg has been shaving her eyebrows.</p><p><h2>Kaley Cuoco</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cae/c55/7f86f65056a2bde51cba6fe4df.jpg><p>After an&nbsp;accident that happened in&nbsp;2010 when a&nbsp;horse jumped on&nbsp;the actress’ leg, <a href=# title="Kaley Cuoco" data-link=tag>Kaley Cuoco</a> has had a&nbsp;scar. Cuoco was transported to&nbsp;the&nbsp;ER because her leg was severely broken. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;stabilize the position of&nbsp;the bones, the doctors had to&nbsp;put 2&nbsp;metal rods inside her leg. And now you can see a&nbsp;long scar on&nbsp;her ankle.</p><p>Who amazed you the most? Whose story was the most unexpected for you?
