Thirty-six percent of male Democrats said they are more likely to watch Kelly on NBC News, compared to 29 percent of Republican men who said they are less likely to do the same. The change was smaller among women — 18 percent of female Democrats said they are more likely to watch Kelly on NBC News, versus 25 percent of Republican women who said her move makes them less likely to watch her program. Forty-seven percent of adults polled said her move will have no effect on their inclination to tune in.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kelly-final.png alt=kelly-final width=2896 height=2285 sizes="(max-width: 2896px) 100vw, 2896px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Twenty-nine percent of people who voted for Hillary Clinton last November and 27 percent of people who voted for President Barack Obama in 2012 said they are more likely to watch Kelly on NBC News. Twenty-six percent of people who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 said they are now less likely to watch Kelly on television.</p><p>Kelly has a shot at bringing in some younger viewers, too. Twenty-seven percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 and 28 percent of people aged 30-44 said Kelly’s jump to NBC News makes them more likely to watch her on television.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/megyn-kelly_age25-54.png alt=megyn-kelly_age25-54 width=2896 height=2532 sizes="(max-width: 2896px) 100vw, 2896px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Thirty-four percent of adults said they have a favorable view of Kelly, while 38 percent were ambivalent or did not know her.
