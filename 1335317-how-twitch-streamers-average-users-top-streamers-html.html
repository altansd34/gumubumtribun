Let’s use an example to shed some light on this.</p><p class=align-left>Suppose you are an average affiliated streamer who only has revenue through Twitch. You have seven tier 1 subscribers and 3500 bits per month. Here is the breakdown of your revenue</p><p class=align-left><strong>Subscription: </strong>7*4.99 = 34.93</p><p class=align-left>Divide this by two as Twitch takes a 50% cut from affiliates. This leaves you with <strong><i>$17.465.</i></strong></p><p class=align-left><strong>Bit donations:</strong> I bit =1c</p><p class=align-left>So, from your 3500 bits, you will earn 3500/2 = 1750c (The platform takes a 50% cut from affiliates here as well), which is the same as <strong><i>$17.50.</i></strong></p><p class=align-left>That means that in a month, you will earn approximately <strong><i>$35.</i></strong></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d9b2e5e057684f16.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All you need to know about the betting site, Lionsbet</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Top streamers, on the other hand, earn way more than this.
