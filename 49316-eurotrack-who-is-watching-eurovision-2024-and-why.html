Denmark has seen a more modest five point fall (to 29%), while in Britain there has actually been a five point increase in likelihood to watch this year’s contest.</p><p data-block-key=ctdlr>Most people across the eight countries surveyed say they have watched Eurovision before, with the exception of Italy, at 47%. The most avid Eurovision nations are Spain (88%), Sweden (85%) and Denmark (82%) – here in Britain 72% of people say they have ever watched it.</p><h3 data-block-key=gnadk id=where-is-eurovision-most-seen-as-a-big-event>Where is Eurovision most seen as a big event?</h3><p data-block-key=282ta>In terms of how popular people perceive the contest to be in their country, Sweden leads the pack with 64% saying it is a big event, up eight points from 2019. This may be in part due to 2024’s contest being held in the country for the seventh time.</p><p data-block-key=c5bdc>The British public view Eurovision as a much bigger event now than in 2019. Just 23% called it a big or fairly big event five years ago, a figure which has since doubled to 46%.</p><p data-block-key=5rdh0>French people are least likely to share this sentiment, with just 19% saying Eurovision is a big deal in France.</p><h3 data-block-key=f1r8j id=why-do-europeans-watch-eurovision>Why do Europeans watch Eurovision?</h3><p data-block-key=dg406>The most popular reasons for watching Eurovision in Britain surround irony.</p><p data-block-key=6tee8>Half (52%) who intend to watch the contest this year say they tune in because they find the commentary amusing, a nod to Graham Norton’s hosting of UK coverage each year, and Brits are most likely out of all European countries surveyed to say they watch to make fun of it (28%). This is compared to just 4-12% of viewers in other countries.</p><p data-block-key=9odf9>Viewers in the rest of Europe seem to take the contest more seriously – watching because they like the music is a popular reason across the board and is most popular in Italy (65%). Similarly, seeing how people from other countries perform is another popular reason for watching across all countries.</p><h3 data-block-key=6y0n1 id=are-europeans-voting-based-on-performance-or-politics>Are Europeans voting based on performance, or politics?</h3><p data-block-key=a41qg>The motivation behind how the public votes in the contest has long been discussed, and Spain stands out from all other countries in believing that their fellow countrymen vote solely for political reasons (41%). Those in Switzerland (8%), Sweden (8%) and Germany (11%) are much less likely to agree. The most common belief is that the general public in each country vote on a mixture of political reasons and on merit of each performance, with those in Britain (46%), Denmark (47%) and Switzerland (45%) being most likely to believe this.</p><p data-block-key=anjah>The Italians are the most optimistic about how their public votes, with 36% saying that they vote solely on the merit of each performance.</p><p data-block-key=7b1jh><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=3ttje>What do you think of Eurovision, Britain's entry this year, and everything else?
