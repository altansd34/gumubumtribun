After her daughter was born, the new mom couldn’t help but notice that the <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a> looked nothing like her. She agreed to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;paternity test, but the results left her husband in&nbsp;shock.</p><p>“I&nbsp;have been married to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband for 2&nbsp;years and gave birth to&nbsp;our daughter 5&nbsp;weeks ago. What happened was that our daughter came out with blonde hair and pale blue eyes, while my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have brown hair and brown eyes.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband freaked out at&nbsp;this and refused to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;my&nbsp;explanation that, sometimes, babies are born with lighter hair and eyes that get darker over time. He&nbsp;demanded a&nbsp;paternity test and threatened to&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> me&nbsp;if&nbsp;I didn’t comply, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b6f/de8/9d751d514dbb147afc4cc672d8.jpg><p>“After my&nbsp;daughter and&nbsp;I got home from the hospital, my&nbsp;husband went to&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;his parents’ house for the first three weeks to&nbsp;get some space from me&nbsp;while I&nbsp;recovered, and he&nbsp;told them what was happening.</p><p>My&nbsp;MIL called and informed me&nbsp;that if&nbsp;the paternity test revealed that the child wasn’t his, she would do&nbsp;anything within her power to&nbsp;make sure that&nbsp;I was ’taken to&nbsp;the cleaners’ during the divorce. I&nbsp;had my&nbsp;sister to&nbsp;lean on&nbsp;and help me&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the baby during this.</p><p>We&nbsp;got the results back yesterday, and my&nbsp;husband came home to&nbsp;view them with&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;was on&nbsp;the couch in&nbsp;the living room, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;sat next to&nbsp;me, and we&nbsp;started to&nbsp;read the results. They showed that he&nbsp;was the father and my&nbsp;husband had this shocked, kinda mortified look on&nbsp;his face with his eyes wide as&nbsp;he&nbsp;stared at&nbsp;it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba4/bc9/0302b556258300970ef5614d15.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;couldn’t help but say, ’I told you so,’ and started laughing at&nbsp;the way he&nbsp;looked. My&nbsp;husband snapped out of&nbsp;his shock, and got mad at&nbsp;me&nbsp;for laughing at&nbsp;him. We&nbsp;argued for a&nbsp;bit, which was mainly him yelling at&nbsp;me.</p><p>After that, my&nbsp;husband went back to&nbsp;his parents’ house to ’clear his head,’ and two-three hours later, my&nbsp;MIL called to&nbsp;scold me&nbsp;about laughing in&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband’s face, because apparently it&nbsp;was kicking him while he&nbsp;was down.</p><p>I&nbsp;don’t think&nbsp;I was wrong, but I’d like outsider perspective on&nbsp;this.”</p><p><h2>People took her side.</h2></p><ul><li>“Not only doesn’t your husband have a&nbsp;basic grasp of&nbsp;genetics, he&nbsp;threw a&nbsp;tantrum and left you immediately after having the baby to&nbsp;struggle alone for almost a&nbsp;month. He’s lucky all you did was laugh in&nbsp;his face.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>CrystalQueen3000&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I both have dark brown hair and dark eyes.

He&nbsp;abandoned you postpartum and forced you to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;newborn by&nbsp;yourself while healing.<br>My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I also have a&nbsp;baby that looks nothing like either of&nbsp;us. She came out with strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes, while we&nbsp;both have brown hair and brown eyes. We&nbsp;both just said wow, genetics are crazy and moved&nbsp;on.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Character_Figure_194&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“The fact he&nbsp;ran to&nbsp;mummy (twice!) and allows her to&nbsp;send you these texts is&nbsp;disgusting.

A&nbsp;new mom was grateful that her MIL offered to&nbsp;babysit her baby when she returned to&nbsp;work, but she became suspicious when the baby started to&nbsp;behave strangely. After the woman set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;spy camera, she <a href=#>discovered</a> something about her MIL that made her doubt her decision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6pbHMmqWdnZRirm68wK2cq6aZqcZuwMSsq2aZnpl6tbTEZqmeq6WhwbR5y56drWWlqHqju9OhZKKmXai1sK%2FKZm9qcWVtf3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
