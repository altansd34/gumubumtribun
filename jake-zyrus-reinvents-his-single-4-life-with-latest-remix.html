In collaboration with musicians Cheesa and John Concepcion, the singer has successfully created the remix. Evidently, Zyrus is proud with this release.</p><p>Back in December 2022, the “I’ll Be There” singer stated that he’s now taking control of his music career. According to him, while he still sees himself working in his home country the Philippines, he’s “more focused” in establishing his reputation in the US.</p><p>“I’m more focused on doing online content, releasing music, and definitely more songs. ‘4 Life’ is just the beginning,” he <a href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Apparently, “4 Life” Remix is an anticipated musical release from Zyrus. The singer mentioned last year that he’d be working on a remixed version in 2023. Furthermore, the singer will also be recording an acoustic version of the song, although the release date isn’t clear yet.</p><p>As regards the creative process of “4 Life,” Zyrus explained that he didn’t force himself to do it. There only came a day where he felt prepared to do the mixing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-life-remix-is-sonically-pumping-worth-listening-to>‘4 Life’ Remix is Sonically Pumping, Worth-Listening To</h2><p>Upon its release, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“4 Life” studio version</a> is unsurprisingly similar to the musical vibes given by Chris Brown. This is apparently because the single was created by Concepcion who has also worked with Brown in the past. Fair enough, Zyrus is admittedly inspired by the music produced by both Brown and Justin Bieber.</p><p>The original version of “4 Life” is already a force to be reckoned with. However, Zyrus has further proven that the song could be as flexible as it is with “4 Life” remix. Sonically, the single taps a listener’s energetic senses, but not in an aggressive and excessive way. Despite it being a remix, it didn’t leave its pleasing and calming sound.</p><p>Moreover, Zyrus made the right choice in enlisting Cheesa to be once again, a part of his release. Both musicians have proven their artistic chemistry prior to the remix as they’ve done a number of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cover songs before</a>.</p><p>Overall, “4 Life” remix is a single worth-listening to. Zyrus is manifestly stepping up his game this year, and we’re yet to see how much he can give to found his career outside his country.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_AmandaHolden_Dominic-LipinskiGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Amanda Holden Suffers Cheeky Wardrobe Malfunction While Filming ‘Britain’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Charice Pempengco</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Jake Zyrus</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZqinmWqrr%2B2v4yrnKKmppq7tb%2BMoaCsZaOeu6i4xGZrZqSZm7Juw8itn2akkamytMCMq5ymoahk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
