Bowman recalled a time she received a FaceTime call when “didn’t have on no hair and no bra.” The experience was so embarrassing that now she rejects FaceTime calls when she receives them.</p><p>“I forgot,” Bowman said about the fact that FaceTime involves video. “I didn’t know until halfway through the thing that he could see me. I’m just on the bed, flopping … No, I don’t like it. Go to the next question.”</p><p>Bowman also spoke out against online dating. She shared that the last time she was with a man was 2011. When Hudson asked “what happened to him,” Bowman responded, “He died. My husband.” Anderson joked, “I’m never bringing you on another daytime talk show.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ANTHONY ANDERSON’S MOTHER, DORIS BOWMAN</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-anderson-sings-and-i-am-telling-you>Anderson Sings ‘And I Am Telling You’</h2><p>During their interview, Hudson asked Anderson to sing a little bit, prompting him to break out his rendition of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” which Hudson famously performed as part of her Oscar-winning role in Dreamgirls.</p><p>Hudson tried to harmonize with him, but she said he “went a little left” with it.
