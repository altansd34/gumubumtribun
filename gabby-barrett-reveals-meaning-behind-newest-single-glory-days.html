According to Barrett, the song attempts to remind people that making every day count is important.</p><p>“I wrote Glory Days with a couple of friends and when we wrote it, we just thought about the amount of life I’ve lived in a short amount of time… it’s been quite a bit, not your average,” she said. “We wrote this song just about how being in the glory days and in its presence right now, is something you will look back on and just enjoy the moment of those glory days right now.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Idol</a> alum put out the song on June 9, 2023, marking the fifth single she’s dropped as an artist. Such release greatly delighted her fans who have long been anticipating her second album.</p><p>For those who may not know, Barrett has quite a record for good songwriting. Her first two singles, “I Hope” and “The Good Ones” have reached No. 1 on the country charts before. Understandably, her second album is well-awaited by her supporters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-s-almost-done-touring-with-kane-brown>She’s Almost Done Touring with Kane Brown</h2><p>This month, Barrett’s days have been jam-packed as she is hitting the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">road</a> with Kane Brown. The Pittsburgh native is currently serving as Brown’s supporting act for his headlining tour.</p><p>Barrett, who kicked off the tour last June 2 in St. Augustine, Florida, has already made stops in Colorado, New Mexico, and Maine. She is then set to join Brown on his shows in Massachusetts and Virginia.</p><p>Yet, amid business, the country singer seemed to have always found time for family.&nbsp;On Instagram, the singer posted about her spending a pamper day with her first born Baylah during her second birthday. She also posted about painting with Baylah outside.</p><p>Last Father’s Day, she paid tribute to her husband for being “crucial” to their family. She also stated that she’s “beyond thankful” to watch him love their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Original_ChrissyTeigen_DiaDipasupil_GettyImages.jpg alt="Chrissy Teigen Claps Back at Plastic Surgeon Who Made a Mockery of Her Face" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>gabby barrett</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xpqZm7Fdl66zvsStq2aqlauyorjSZqSemZ6eu6h5wZ6foqaUYrumw8Ssq2armaO0rbGMoKOoqqlisaLF0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
