The law change led to <a href=#>a fundraising campaign</a> for a couple who were fined £630 for taking their children on a week-long holiday during school term, and <a href=#>a petition</a> – which passed the 100,000 signatures required to be considered in parliament – calling for holiday companies to stop exploiting the increased demand outside of term-time.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/In20term20holidays.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Now a new YouGov poll finds that 60% think such fines, which <a href=#>reportedly</a> a quarter of primary schools have imposed, should not be issued to parents who take their children on holiday during term time without the permission of a headteacher. Only 31% say they should be imposed.</p><p>51% of teachers also think fines should not be imposed, while 42% think they should.</p><p>Additionaly, most people (53%) think parents should be permitted to take children out of school during term time to go on family holidays, while 40% think they should not. Here, however, teachers disagree: 58% say they should not be permitted and 35% say they should.</p><p>Much of the motivation for stopping parents taking their children away outside of school holidays focuses on the damage it does to learning. <a href=#>According to Bradford council</a>, between September 2012 and Easter 2013 more than 41,000 days of education were lost from parents doing so, which can “seriously harm the children's progress and attainment".</p><p>But three quarters (76%) of the public think that children missing one or two days from school in order to go on a family holiday does not significantly damage their education, as do 68% of teachers.</p><p>Campaigners say the change is hitting families who cannot afford the cost of a holiday during school breaks. <a href=#>They say</a> a trip in the summer holiday is over £1,000 more expensive than one during term-time, ‘Soon only rich kids would be able to go on holiday and that's unfair on everyone else.’</p><p>Image: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full poll results</strong></a></p><p class=title><a href=#>Join YouGov today!
