These “celebrity” dresses become trendy and many girls chose similar gowns for their weddings.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have looked into the most memorable and original wedding dresses of&nbsp;all time from famous women. And in&nbsp;the bonus section, you will find out who started the trend of&nbsp;wearing white when getting married.</p><p><h2>Elizabeth Taylor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5a/909/e4dbcf57f280a2270c02a64c71.jpg><p><a href=# title="Elizabeth Taylor" data-link=tag>Elizabeth Taylor</a> got married <a href=#>several</a> times and all of&nbsp;her wedding looks were very original. She first got married when she was 18&nbsp;years old. She wore a&nbsp;satin dress with a&nbsp;long train that was covered with glass beads and pearls, which was designed by&nbsp;<a href=#>Helen Rose</a>. During her wedding ceremony with Michael Wilding, Elizabeth Taylor was wearing a&nbsp;new look that included a&nbsp;jacket. She wore an&nbsp;unusual dress with a&nbsp;thin scarf on&nbsp;her head when she was getting married to&nbsp;Eddie Fisher. And during her wedding to&nbsp;Richard Burton, she wore a&nbsp;yellow dress that was very fashionable at&nbsp;the time.</p><p><h2>Grace Kelly</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ea/bdf/459b6f5abe81a820ed471ae6fb.jpg><p><a href=# title="Grace Kelly" data-link=tag>Grace Kelly</a>’s wedding <a href=#>dress</a> became one of&nbsp;the most famous wedding dresses in&nbsp;history. But few people know about the second outfit she wore during her wedding with Prince Rainier. She wore a&nbsp;<a href=#>taffeta</a> dress with white lace (shown above).</p><p><h2>Brigitte Bardot</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d87/286/7fb9af5d949fd7972c8d516be5.jpg><p>During her second <a href=#>wedding</a> with actor Jacques Charrier, Brigitte wore a&nbsp;gingham dress. The dress was made by&nbsp;designer Jacques Esterel and the wedding photos of&nbsp;the star were printed in&nbsp;every magazine and newspaper of&nbsp;the time.</p><p><h2>Liza Minnelli</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a45/85e/dc0f5f54c98146f07662b944c8.jpg><p>Liza Minnelli’s wedding dress, in&nbsp;<a href=#>1967</a>, was far ahead of&nbsp;its time: brides didn’t wear these kinds of&nbsp;dresses, they usually preferred shorter and fuller dresses. Instead, Liza wore a&nbsp;blouse and a&nbsp;smooth skirt. She looked very avant-garde in&nbsp;this outfit.</p><p><h2>Audrey Hepburn</h2></p><p><a href=# title="Audrey Hepburn" data-link=tag>Audrey Hepburn</a> chose a&nbsp;<a href=#>minimalistic</a> dress when she was <a href=#>marrying</a> Italian psychiatrist Andrea Dotti in&nbsp;1969. She wore a&nbsp;pale pink Givenchy dress with long sleeves. Instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;veil, she had a&nbsp;headscarf which ended up&nbsp;being a&nbsp;great accessory. In&nbsp;the ’70s, Audrey Hepburn-style dresses became popular with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;brides. At&nbsp;that time, many girls wore short dresses at&nbsp;their weddings.</p><p><h2>Bianca Jagger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/361/3ad/5a53ed503d9d2651490a35cb8e.jpg><p>Instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dress in&nbsp;<a href=#>1971</a>, Bianca chose a&nbsp;white 2-piece suit that consisted of&nbsp;a&nbsp;maxi dress and a&nbsp;jacket with very deep cleavage. The bride looked very extravagant at&nbsp;the time: it&nbsp;looked as&nbsp;if&nbsp;there were no&nbsp;clothes under her jacket. In&nbsp;reality, she was wearing a&nbsp;top that was just very hard to&nbsp;see. The outfit was on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;the most elegant outfits of&nbsp;the 20th century. It&nbsp;was made by&nbsp;Yves Saint Laurent. He&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;highlight the personality of&nbsp;the bride.</p><p><h2>Mariah Carey</h2></p><p>The singer’s <a href=#>marriage</a> with Tommy Mottola started in&nbsp;1993 and only lasted 4&nbsp;years. But the dress became very popular because it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;very long train (27&nbsp;ft). After the marriage, <a href=# title="Mariah Carey" data-link=tag>Mariah Carey</a> didn’t sell the dress nor did she give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;museum. She actually wanted to&nbsp;<a href=#>burn</a> it&nbsp;while shooting a&nbsp;music video, even though it&nbsp;cost $25,000.</p><p><h2>Celine Dion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb5/c4a/d2101e5bc6b9e5452670aa1064.jpg><p>Even though it’s been 26&nbsp;years since her marriage, this <a href=#>dress</a> is&nbsp;still actively discussed by&nbsp;fashion designers from around the world. Some people think it’s one of&nbsp;the best in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;wedding dresses, and some people think it’s way too over-the-top. The main highlight was the massive accessory on&nbsp;Celine’s head. It&nbsp;had 2,000 Swarovski crystals and weighed over 6&nbsp;lbs. Not every woman would want this kind of&nbsp;look.</p><p><h2>Kate Moss</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9c/36d/a7bc445cddb603082f6fe6c2ab.jpg><p><a href=# title="Kate Moss" data-link=tag>Kate Moss</a>’s dress for her wedding ceremony with the guitarist of&nbsp;The Kills, <a href=#>Jamie Hince</a>, was made by&nbsp;her old friend <a href=#>John Galliano</a>. The slim-fitted cream dress had <a href=#>rhinestones</a> on&nbsp;it. While working on&nbsp;the dress, Galliano was <a href=#>inspired</a> by&nbsp;the image of&nbsp;Zelda Fitzgerald. And even Kate’s wedding ring looked like Zelda’s ring, since her engagement ring was from Zelda which was thus the inspiration.</p><p><h2>Miranda Kerr</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b0/1fe/293f7957b4b9090288f0a429e4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Miranda said that she started to&nbsp;dream about what her dress would look like right after her engagement. In&nbsp;the end, she was <a href=#>inspired</a> by&nbsp;Grace Kelly’s wedding look. And the idea was brought to&nbsp;life by&nbsp;the creative director of&nbsp;Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri. Just as&nbsp;the bride wanted, the dress looked simple, but still impressive.</p><p><h2>Meghan Markle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5be/2bf/111d3156b3b14984b8de92d69e.jpg><p><a href=#>Meghan</a> chose a&nbsp;simple, elegant, and exquisite dress with an&nbsp;open boat neckline and long sleeves. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews, she revealed a&nbsp;little secret: the dress had a&nbsp;small piece of&nbsp;<a href=#>blue</a> fabric from the dress she wore on&nbsp;her first date with Harry. The bride’s veil was embroidered with flowers representing the countries of&nbsp;the Commonwealth.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Queen Victoria</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/83e/60b/302ea95e059a13c68238141ef3.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past, women would get married in&nbsp;dresses that didn’t have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;white. It&nbsp;was <a href=#>Queen Victoria</a> that got married in&nbsp;white in&nbsp;1840, which was when this tendency became trendy and it&nbsp;still&nbsp;is. Victoria’s dress was made of&nbsp;English silk and was decorated with lace. Interestingly, the design of&nbsp;her dress was <a href=#>destroyed</a> so&nbsp;that nobody could have the same lace patterns as&nbsp;the Queen did.</p><p>Have you ever dreamed of&nbsp;trying on&nbsp;any of&nbsp;these wedding dresses?
