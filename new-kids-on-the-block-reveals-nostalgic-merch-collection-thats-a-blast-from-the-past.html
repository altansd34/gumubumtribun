Who says having 90s boy band merch in your room is a thing of the past? The group just launched a new line of <strong>Blockhead</strong></strong> <strong>merchandise inspired by their bedsheet collection that was a best-seller nearly two decades ago.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-new-kids-on-the-block-releases-collection-inspired-by-popular-90-s-bedsheets>New Kids on the Block Releases Collection Inspired by Popular 90’s Bedsheets</h2><p><a href=#>Donnie Wahlberg</a>, Joey McIntyre, Danny Wood, and Jonathan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jordan Knight’s colorful headshots adorn the new collection. Even though the sheet collection is from the ’90s, die-hard fans have held onto them for all these years. The original sheet sets are being resold on eBay ranging from $44-$135.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, one fan even used the New Kids on the Block bedsheets to make face masks. They donated all of the proceeds from the masks to Wood’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Remember Betty foundation</a> to support cancer patients. Others have turned the sheets into clothing items, a great way to repurpose the fabric. All of this inspired the two-time American Music Award-winning band to give the people what they want.</p><p>This new merch collection featuring the throwback print includes oven mitts, coasters, pint glasses, coffee mugs, aprons, dishtowels, face masks, and a throw blanket. All of the products are already available on the official New Kids on the Block <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website.</a> The best part about it is that it is all very affordable, ranging from $10-$50. There is also more merch on the way that will be dropping very soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CQba72nhp4u/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>“If you asked the five of us what we thought of those bedsheets back in the day, we would have had some expletives to describe them probably,”<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Wood said</a> about the original bedsheets collection. “But now when we meet fans we always hear them say to us: ‘You were my first concert’ and ‘I used to sleep on you!’ Or sometimes they’ll say, ‘I used to sleep on your face!’ if they’re trying to be extra funny. So we’ve now embraced things like those sheets because it’s just fun for everyone.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-this-announcement-is-a-big-hit-with-their-massive-fanbase>This Announcement is a Big Hit with Their Massive Fanbase</h2><p>The comments section on both Instagram and Twitter following the merch announcement is all positive. New Kids on the Block has been able to keep their fanbase satisfied since they got back together in 2008. One fan even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted her receipt</a> to show that she bought $130 worth of merch.</p><p>The group has announced summer concert dates including their rescheduled Fenway Park show on August 6. This is the same show Walhberg announced on the day of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his Masked Singer reveal</a> that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gave away his identity</a> before the show even aired. His wife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenny McCarthy</a> had no idea that he was under the mask.</p><p>On Instagram, members of the band each posed in bedrooms decked out in Blockhead merchandise. The dolls, the bulletin board with photographs, and the tiny twin bed are giving off so much nostalgia. Will you be buying anything from the new collection?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CQROU7OJvRD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pam-and-Casper-Pam-and-Casper-Americas-Got-Talent-Americas-Got-Talent-AGT.jpg alt="‘America’s Got Talent’ Judges Are Totally Obsessed with Singing Chihuahua" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>donnie wahlberg</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zZ6uZqOZmcBuu81mq6GdXZe5sK%2FKZqmerpWWubR5zaiqrZmcnLakecyeqZygXZi8rbjEnKuip55iwamt06xkmmWSoa60wIyfqailXam1pnnPmqqtZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
