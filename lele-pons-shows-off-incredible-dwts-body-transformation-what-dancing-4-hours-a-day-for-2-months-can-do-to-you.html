The Venezuelan YouTuber recently showed off her seemingly unplanned body transformation due to her time on the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lele-pons-shows-off-toned-body-after-intense-dwts-rehearsals>Lele Pons Shows Off Toned Body After Intense DWTS Rehearsals</h2><p>Following Lele Pons’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Music Video night elimination</a>, she uploaded a series of photos and a clip on Instagram of how her body changed since she joined DWTS season 32. As seen in the snaps, the actress was wearing a white two-piece, looking all sultry with her tanned skin and blonde locks. Pons also showed a throwback photo of herself where she looks noticeably different.</p><p>“What dancing 4 hours a day for two months can do to you and good nutrition. (thank u @<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dancingwiththestars</a>),” she wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after her fans saw the post, they praised Pons’ body transformation. While they commended the personality’s weight loss, they also reminded Pons that she already looked good before the show.</p><p>“YOU WERE SEXY THEN AND YOU’RE STILL SEXY NOW,” a person wrote.</p><p>“You are stunning regardless of your size, however your body now shows you inner self is healthy and glowing. Your health is your wealth,” another user commented.</p><p>If you didn’t know, Pons and her partner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brandon Armstrong</a> were eliminated during DWTS’ music video-themed episode. Amusingly, the YouTube star’s strong performance that night failed to save her from leaving the show. While the result was upsetting for both the viewers and judges, Pons nonetheless remained thankful for her journey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-brandon-armstrong-paid-tribute-to-her-amid-their-exit>Brandon Armstrong Paid Tribute to Her Amid Their Exit</h2><p>After the stunning elimination, Armstrong made his stand and told the judges Pons didn’t deserve to be sent home. Later, however, in a much calmer attitude, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro paid tribute to Pons on Instagram with media of their memories together.</p><p>“This season has been such a great time for me professionally but even better personally. I knew right when I met Lele that the two of us would be friends forever!” he wrote.</p><p>According to Armstrong, it’s been a “fun ride” with Pons from the first day to the last.</p><p>“Sucks that it ended early cause I feel like we had so many more memories to make but we definitely made some great ones. You worked so hard and cared so much that it pushed me to be better and I owe you for that!” he wrote. “Hopefully I helped you fall in love with dance and can’t wait till we do it again!”</p><p>Pons also previously posted a farewell message on her Instagram. The Venezuelan star gave Armstrong a special shoutout to her DWTS partner.</p><p>“Thank you for teaching me everything i know and pushing me to be better each week! I was shocked too about what at happened last night but can’t focus on the bad when there were so many great memories!” she wrote.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_ArianaGrande_EthanSlater-220x147.jpg alt="We’re Still Not Over Ariana Grande, Ethan Slater Being Photographed Together For The First Time" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y56jnmWgpLu0edKhprCrXaSzp3nIp5qrnZSer62xjJ2uratdl7ylxYytqZqmo5u8s7nAraCopl2staLAjJ2Yp5uZo7RugIyhpq6qo2KubrDAsmSfp6Jif265zqeroatdmK6vecOoZK2nXa68tns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
