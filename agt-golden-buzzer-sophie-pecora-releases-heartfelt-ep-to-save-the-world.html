Alongside the EP’s release, she dropped a lyric video for the title track. The 18-year-old singer earned a Golden Buzzer in Season 14 of the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sophie-pecora-releases-new-ep-to-save-the-world>Sophie Pecora Releases New EP ‘To Save the World’</h2><p>On Friday, Sophie put out a new five-song EP, featuring the title track “The Save the World,” as well as “Pretty People,” “I’m Fine,” “I’m in a Rut,” and “Bring Me Down.” The songs deal with issues such as self-confidence and mental health. Each song shows off Sophie’s signature singer-songwriter style and rapping skills.</p><p>In the lyric video for “To Save the World,” Sophie stands outside playing guitar and singing the heartfelt lyrics: “If all it took was someone to care / If purely love could rid of all evil / Then even though I am just a girl / I’d be the one to save the world.”</p><p>“I was feeling overwhelmed by the news and what’s happening in the world,” Sophie said of the song in a press release. “I was feeling like if all it took was someone to care a lot, I would be the one to save the world. I care so much and was wishing that how I was feeling could translate to saving other people who are going through so much hardship, heartache, and pain.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘AGT’ FANS OUTRAGED OVER SOPHIE PECORA ELIMINATION</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sophie-earned-the-golden-buzzer-on-america-s-got-talent-season-14>Sophie Earned the Golden Buzzer on ‘America’s Got Talent’ Season 14</h2><p>At the age of 15, Sophie Pecora took the AGT stage to sing an original song called “7th Grade,” about her experience with bullies.
