There are more women in the church than men, which means the strategic asset of the church across the nation is the women.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fbdadec31a5ea189.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wike vs Fubara: Rivers governor defends surprise visit to lawmakers' quarters</span></p></a>“Even nations, the strategic assets are women and the young people because your investment in the young person, if you build right, you will derive more value because expectedly, they have longer years to give value back to you, so your investment will return to you.“So, getting young people’s mindset right early enough saves them a lot of trouble and also helps the nation, the community, and the church to have them perform maximally for a much more extended period.“But getting the women right means maximizing the most significant portion of the church's population. It is not a gender thing; if you look at it from a business perspective, what do you do with your most significant asset?“If nations are brilliant, if you have a 50-50 gender population and your 50 percent is undermined, you are already disadvantaged. It doesn’t matter how hard the core 50 percent you are investing in works because if another nation only takes 20 percent of that other population and adds to their core male 50 percent, they will outperform you.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f832e2fc864307f2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man who spent N1.3 million to install Elon Musk's Starlink in village makes interesting discovery</span></p></a>“So, it is a strategic decision for nations, churches, and communities to invest in maximizing the talent that women have.”<p class=align-left>Church empowers members</p><p class=align-left>On her part, Pastor Dayo Benjamins-Laniyi, the Mandate Secretary for the Women Affairs Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory Administration, said: “We need women to support each other, to lead each other, to invest in each other.</p>“This for me has become a model of intentional humanitarian intervention. Woman to woman, you invest in her, and you accelerate progress.
