Castilian or&nbsp;Castellano, is the official language in the country and is spoken by the majority of people. However, of Spain’s sixteen autonomous communities, six have co-official languages in addition to Castilian. Bilingualism of various degrees, then, is common in the country. In addition, many people call a foreign language their mother tongue or at least speak it. So what other languages does Spain speak?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Castilian>Castilian</h2><p>Nearly 94% of the population in Spain <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speaks Spanish</a>, but only about 82% call it their mother tongue. With more than 45 million people speaking Spanish in the country, Spain ranks number three together with Colombia among the countries with the most Spanish speakers, after Mexico and the United States.</p><p>Spanish is a Romance language with origins in the Castile region of the country, which is where the name <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Castilian</a> or&nbsp;castellano&nbsp;comes from. The language as it exists today was also influenced by the Mozarabic dialect of the Muslim kingdom of Toledo.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reconquista</a>&nbsp;in the Middle Ages expanded the Spanish language across the Iberian peninsula at the expense of other languages. Commerce, trade and diplomacy in the 16th and 17th centuries further established Spanish, while the Franco dictatorship in the 20th century prohibited the use of regional languages. The 1978 Constitution recognized the territories’ regional languages as co-official languages, laying the groundwork for bilingualism as it exists today in Spain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Catalan>Catalan</h2><p>A little over 15% of the Spanish population speaks some form of Catalan, while only 8.5% call it their mother tongue. The Romance language Catalan has its name from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">region of Catalonia</a> in the northeast of Spain and adjoining parts of France.</p><p>Catalan is a co-official language in the autonomous communities of Catalonia and the only official language in Andorra. There are roughly 4.5 million speakers – which grows to 7 million – when counting all variants of the language, including&nbsp;<strong>Valencian</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Balear</strong>.</p><p>Valencian is classified as a dialect of Catalan by the Royal Spanish Academy, though some Catalans might disagree and consider the dialects languages of their own. Valenciano, as the name suggests, is spoken in the autonomous community of Valencia. Balear or Balearic Catalan is spoken in the Balearic Islands and makes up the eastern variety of Catalan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Galician>Galician</h2><p>The co-official language in Galicia is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Galician, or&nbsp;gallego</a>. The variant&nbsp;Eonavian&nbsp;is spoken in Asturias and takes the name of Galician-Asturian. Approximately three million people in Spain speak Galician, which makes up 5.5% of the population.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">If you speak Spanish</a>, Galician is the easiest regional language in Spain to acquire and it’s related to Portuguese, with which it once formed the linguistic unity of Galician-Portuguese. The three main dialects of Galician are western, central and eastern.</p><p>The term&nbsp;gallego&nbsp;to denote a Spaniard, especially used in Latin America, originates from the fact that many Spanish settlers in North and South America came from Galicia or, at least, started their journey to the ‘new world’ from there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Basque>Basque</h2><p>In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Basque country</a> and parts of Navarre, the co-official language is Basque. Apart from standard Basque, six main dialects exist. A little less than one million people speak Basque today, or about 1.2% of Spain’s population. Only 0.8 percent call it their mother tongue. The Basque language is distinct in its pronunciation, syntax and grammar. It differs completely from&nbsp;&nbsp;Castilian Spanish.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Occitan-/-Arenese>Occitan / Arenese</h2><p>Occitan is a Romance language spoken in the Aran valley in Spain, where it is also called Aranese and spoken natively by less than 3,000 people. Additionally, Occitan is a co-official language in all of Catalonia.</p><p>The region of Occitania spreads across Southern France, Monaco and Italy’s Occitan valleys. In Spain, it includes the Aran valley. Catalan is a close relative to Occitan and was considered its dialect until the end of the 19th century.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Spanish-dialects:-the-less-common-languages-in-Spain>Spanish dialects: the less common languages in Spain</h2><p>The different regions of the Iberian peninsula had their own languages, but without a status as official or co-official language in today’s Spain, they’re relegated to the role of the many <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish dialects</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Extremaduran</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Approximately 200.000 people in Extremadura and areas of Salamanca speak&nbsp;castuó&nbsp;or Extremduran.</li><li><strong>Cantabrian</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;A group of dialects belonging to Astur-Leonese and spoken by 120.000 people in the autonomous community of Cantabria in the north of Spain.</li><li><strong>Asturian:</strong>&nbsp;Around half a million people speak the Romance language Asturian.</li><li><strong>Aragonese</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;A modern language which originated from Navarro-Aragonese and spoken by some 30.000 people in Aragon.</li><li><strong>Leonese</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Romance dialects home to the historical region of León in Spain are subsumed under the term Leonese and spoken by nearly 50.000 people.</li><li><strong>Altoaragonese:</strong>&nbsp;The province of Huesca, close to Zaragoza, is home to 12.000 speakers of this endangered and protected, yet unofficial, language.</li><li><strong>Fala Galaico-Extremeña</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Between Extremadura and Portugal, only 6.000 people speak this language.</li><li><strong>Murcian</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;The region of Murcia and adjacent regions are home to this southern dialect of Spanish.</li><li><strong>Silbo Gomero:</strong>&nbsp;Classified as a UNESCO Intangible Heritage of Humanity, Silbo Gomero is a whistling language or codex invented and used by the aborigines of the Canary Islands. The loud sounds allowed for communication across valleys and ravines and distances of up to five kilometers. In essence, it’s a transposition of Spanish speech to whistling. Silbo Gomero is still electively taught at school on the island La Gomera.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Foreign-languages-spoken-in-Spain>Foreign languages spoken in Spain</h2><p>More than 6 million people living in Spain were born in other countries, which makes up just above 13 percent of the population. What other languages do they speak in Spain? The majority of immigrants in Spain come from other European countries, but also Latin America, northern Africa, Asia or Russia.</p><p>Immigrant languages therefore include Latin American Spanish, English, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Russion or Tagalog. The following are the most common foreign languages spoken in Spain:</p><ul><li><strong>English:</strong>&nbsp;11.7% of the population speak English, while 0.42% call it their mother tongue.</li><li><strong>French:</strong>&nbsp;5.85 % speak French, with 1.36% native speakers.</li><li><strong>Romanian:</strong>&nbsp;2.78% of the population speak the language, and 2.69% call it their mother tongue.</li><li><strong>Italian:</strong>&nbsp;1.93% of Spanish residents speak Italian, but only 0.1% call it their mother tongue.</li><li><strong>Portuguese:</strong>&nbsp;1.55% of the population speaks the language, with 0.31% native speakers.</li><li><strong>German:</strong>&nbsp;1.22% of residents in Spain speak German, while 0.11% are native speakers.</li><li><strong>Arabic:</strong>&nbsp;0.73% of the population speak Arabaic, 0.63% call the language their mother tongue.</li><li><strong>Russian:</strong>&nbsp;0.3% speak it, 0.1% are native Russian speakers.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>One country, multiple languages</h2><p>Spain is a diverse country with a rich linguistic heritage. While Castellano is the official and most widely spoken language in the country, there are several other regional languages that hold significant importance. Catalan, Galician and Basque are recognized co-official languages in their respective regions, and they are all used in various aspects of daily life, including education and government. The unique linguistic diversity in Spain adds to the cultural richness of the country and reflects its historical and regional identities.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jakob_02-1.jpg><h2>Jakob Straub</h2><p>Jakob is a freelance writer in Barcelona, Spain, and his favorite books have pages all empty.
