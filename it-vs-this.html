The main difference is it is a pronoun and this is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">determiner</a> and a pronoun. Because of the difference in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grammar</a> of this vs it, they are used in distinct ways. In this article, we’ll look at lots of examples so you can learn how to use this vs it correctly.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-use-“it”>How to use “it”</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Subject and object pronoun</h3><p>It can replace a subject or object that has already been referred to in a sentence. In this usage, we only use it to refer to an inanimate object or an animal, not a person. It is a third-person singular <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pronoun</a>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Look at the cat! It is about to pounce on that poor bird.&nbsp;</li><li>Please pick up the book on your way out. It’s on the table.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Weather, time and distance</h3><p>It can be used as a dummy subject when talking about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">weather</a>, time and distances. You cannot use this in these sentences.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It is really hot today.&nbsp;</li><li>It’s ten o’clock.&nbsp;</li><li>It is a long way to Los Angeles from here.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Subject when there is no identifiable actor</h3><p>You can also use it as a dummy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">subject</a> in several constructions.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It is important to be on time for the meeting.&nbsp;</li><li>It is essential that you learn how to drive as we live in a village.&nbsp;</li><li>It is thought that Dr. Jameson will give a presentation.</li><li>It has been shown that paracetamol is helpful in such cases.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cleft sentences</h3><p>It can also be used in cleft sentences. You make these types of sentences when you want to emphasize a certain piece of information.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It was only yesterday when all this happened, so I’m still processing it.&nbsp;</li><li>It is Dean who is responsible for this, not Sarah.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-use-“this”>How to use “this”</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Introducing a person</h3><p>You can use this to introduce a person to someone else or to introduce a thing.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>This is my colleague, Alicia.&nbsp;</li><li>This was my favorite restaurant when I lived here.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Demonstrating something near you</h3><p>Use this when you want to indicate something that is close to you.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>This</strong> is the photo I was talking about! I can’t believe I found it.&nbsp;</li><li>I don’t like <strong>this</strong> room very much. I’d definitely redecorate if I moved here.</li><li>I think you should buy <strong>this</strong> jacket, not that one over there.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Common-mistakes-with-it-and-this>Common mistakes with it and this</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Identifying vs introducing someone</h3><p>One common error is knowing when to use it is vs this is. You can use it is as a dummy subject when you are identifying someone. In contrast, you use this is to introduce someone.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Who’s on the phone? – It’s my sister.&nbsp;</li><li>Who’s this? – This is my sister, Serena.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Referencing</h3><p>You can use both this and it to refer back to something that has already been mentioned, but there is a difference in usage. English learners really often make mistakes with this usage and overuse it. We use it to refer back to a single thing that has already been mentioned. We use this to refer back to whole sentences or previous parts of a text. Take a look at these examples to see the difference between using it and this in this way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>My computer</strong> is essential to me. <strong>It</strong> is the one thing I can’t do without at work. (It refers back to the computer only.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Computers have become essential in the modern workplace</strong>. <strong>This</strong> means that all employers must provide them to their employees. (This refers back to the whole sentence.)</p><p><strong>Our garden</strong> is pretty small. <strong>It </strong>is big enough for us, though.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our garden gets a lot of sun year-round</strong>. <strong>This </strong>allows us to sit outside even in the winter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can you use it and this correctly?</h2><p>Hopefully, with these examples, you’ll be able to use it and this correctly in sentences from now on. Remember that it is a subject and object pronoun that refers to animals and inanimate objects, and can be used as a dummy subject in several constructions, including with time and weather. We use this to introduce people and to demonstrate something nearby.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
