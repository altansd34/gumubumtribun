Your -ity from your -ism? English suffixes, like prefixes, can create new words and meanings. Understanding what suffixes mean will really help when you meet a new word. In this article, we will present the most important and cool suffixes and give example sentences.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>English noun suffixes</strong></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ion</strong></h3><p>Meaning: action or condition</p><p>An example of this English suffix would be: “Lots of people have certain&nbsp;<strong>superstitions</strong>&nbsp;about doing an&nbsp;<strong>examination</strong>.” For example, eating chocolate beforehand brings luck – I always believe this is true. Or using a lucky pen (which is any pen that works, in my experience). The&nbsp;<strong>opinion</strong>&nbsp;of psychologists is that superstitions are helpful in the&nbsp;<strong>creation</strong>&nbsp;of a positive mental attitude. So believe whatever helps you get through!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-dom</strong></h3><p>Meaning: place or state of being</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lingoda’s</a>&nbsp;</strong>lessons can offer you&nbsp;<strong>freedom</strong>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<strong>boredom</strong>&nbsp;of language learning. They will also make you feel more confident when you visit the United&nbsp;<strong>Kingdom</strong>&nbsp;– which should really be called the ‘United Queendom’ at the moment, right? Why isn’t ‘Queendom’ a word?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ty/ity</strong></h3><p>Meaning: quality of</p><p>There are many&nbsp;<strong>qualities</strong>&nbsp;which people look for in friends.&nbsp;<strong>Generosity</strong>, so you know they’ll share the last piece of cake with you.&nbsp;<strong>Humility</strong>, to accept that they are not always better than you.</p><p>A belief in&nbsp;<strong>equality</strong>, so you know they’re a good person. A&nbsp;quality&nbsp;that few people are looking for is&nbsp;<strong>brutality</strong>: mindless violence is rarely attractive.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ism</strong></h3><p>Meaning: doctrine/belief</p><p>During the Cold War, the battle was between the ideologies of&nbsp;<strong>communism</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>socialism</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>capitalism</strong>. Now, over on social media a battle between&nbsp;<strong>narcissism</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;intellectualism</strong>&nbsp;is being played out.</p><p><strong>Racism</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>nationalism</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;terrorism</strong>&nbsp;are often in the news at the moment.</p><p>On the flip side, positive -isms, like<strong>&nbsp;humanitarianism&nbsp;</strong>are all around us, but are not talked about enough in the news.</p><p>Try&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Positive News</a>&nbsp;for an uplifting read, and for practicing your English skills and read examples of suffixes!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ment</strong></h3><p>Meaning: an action or state</p><p>Watching someone eat an entire bag of&nbsp;Maltesers&nbsp;to themselves would be a cause for&nbsp;<strong>amazement</strong>&nbsp;for me. But I would also feel&nbsp;<strong>disappointment&nbsp;</strong>that I didn’t get any. I might even have a&nbsp;<strong>disagreement</strong>&nbsp;or a full-blown&nbsp;<strong>argument</strong>&nbsp;over it. I’m very passionate about&nbsp;Maltesers.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ist</strong></h3><p>Meaning: one who</p><p>Labelling people is a fact of the human condition. So we have proud&nbsp;<strong>feminists</strong>, like Gloria Steinem, and outspoken&nbsp;<strong>atheists</strong>, like Richard Dawkins. Albert Einstein was a&nbsp;<strong>socialist</strong>&nbsp;(and a&nbsp;<strong>scientist</strong>), while Karl Marx was a&nbsp;<strong>communist</strong>. And what about the fascinating phenomenon (and great compound noun)&nbsp;<strong>televangelist</strong>?&nbsp;Television&nbsp;<strong>evangelists</strong>&nbsp;are big in the USA, where people watch preachers ask for money on television in exchange for the blessing of God. Truly captivating TV.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>English verb suffixes</strong></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-en</strong></h3><p>Meaning: make</p><p>You can&nbsp;<strong>sweeten</strong>&nbsp;your tea, and&nbsp;<strong>soften</strong>&nbsp;butter in the kitchen. You can&nbsp;<strong>shorten</strong>&nbsp;your trousers if they are too long, but rarely can you&nbsp;<strong>lengthen</strong>&nbsp;them if they are too short. Concrete&nbsp;<strong>hardens</strong>&nbsp;when it dries, and this also&nbsp;<strong>strengthens</strong>&nbsp;it. That’s why we can walk around the city and not sink into a huge hole, comic-book style. &nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ify</strong></h3><p>Meaning: make or become</p><p>There are few complaints from communities when people try to<strong>&nbsp;beautify</strong>&nbsp;a local area. This might mean a new coat of paint on buildings, or cleaning up the streets. But there are often complaints when an area is&nbsp;<strong>gentrified</strong>.</p><p>People say old suburbs lose their character. Harlem, in New York, and certain areas of Berlin are examples of this.</p><p>Finally here, I would like to&nbsp;<strong>clarify</strong>&nbsp;that the word&nbsp;<strong>mortify</strong>&nbsp;does not mean ‘make dead’, as in its original use. It has evolved into a term for creating deep embarrassment.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ise</strong></h3><p>Meaning: become</p><p>Tabloid newspapers are well-known for their ability to&nbsp;<strong>sensationalise</strong>&nbsp;boring news stories. And to&nbsp;<strong>commercialise</strong>&nbsp;even the most boring story about a celebrity so that it sells.</p><p>The band&nbsp;Big Bang&nbsp;are often said to have&nbsp;<strong>popularised</strong>&nbsp;K-pop outside of Asia, but lots of K-pop bands came before them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=English-adjective-suffixes><strong>English adjective suffixes</strong></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ish</strong></h3><p>Meaning: having the quality of</p><p>If you are feeling&nbsp;<strong>feverish</strong>, you probably want to stay in bed. If you’ve done something silly, you might feel&nbsp;<strong>foolish</strong>; while wanting to keep an entire cake to yourself is&nbsp;<strong>selfish</strong>.</p><p>You can add -ish to an awful lot more words than I knew. For example, who knew&nbsp;<strong>giraffish</strong>&nbsp;was a word? Now I know what to call a tall, gentle person with a very long neck.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ful</strong></h3><p>Meaning: notable for</p><p>Italian sounds like a&nbsp;<strong>beautiful</strong>&nbsp;language, and I am very&nbsp;<strong>hopeful</strong>&nbsp;that I will have the chance to learn it some day. And of course I am&nbsp;<strong>thankful</strong>&nbsp;that I have had the chance to learn Polish. But, I am&nbsp;<strong>doubtful</strong>&nbsp;that I will use it very much in the future.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-less</strong></h3><p>Meaning: without</p><p>Arya Stark in&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of Thrones</a></strong>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<strong>fearless</strong>, which was why a lot of fans loved her for so many seasons.</p><p>However, it is&nbsp;<strong>doubtless</strong>&nbsp;that lots of fans were left&nbsp;<strong>speechless</strong>&nbsp;by the final few episodes of GoT. You should be&nbsp;fearless&nbsp;around most spiders, because they are more than likely to be&nbsp;<strong>harmless</strong>. Unless you’re in Australia.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-al</strong></h3><p>Meaning: Relating to, or having a connection to.</p><p>Lots of people only vote in&nbsp;<strong>national</strong>&nbsp;elections and they ignore&nbsp;<strong>regional&nbsp;</strong>ones. But&nbsp;regional&nbsp;government can have a big impact on<strong>&nbsp;local</strong>&nbsp;lives. In the UK and in many countries around the world, lots of children are growing up&nbsp;<strong>bilingual</strong>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<strong>multilingual</strong>. That means they don’t have to sit through school language lessons – lucky them!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-ive</strong></h3><p>Meaning: having the nature of</p><p>People who are&nbsp;<strong>inventive</strong>&nbsp;can use what they have to make something amazing. Like when my students forget a word and call ‘bananas’ ‘long, yellow things’, or ‘divorce’ ‘when husband goes bye bye’.</p><p>Someone who is&nbsp;<strong>decisive</strong>&nbsp;makes decisions quickly, while a&nbsp;<strong>sensitive</strong>&nbsp;person always considers the feelings of others. &nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>-able/ible</strong></h3><p>Meaning: Able to or capable of being.</p><p>It is sometimes&nbsp;<strong>questionable</strong>&nbsp;whether British food is&nbsp;<strong>edible</strong>&nbsp;(I’m looking at you, Corned Beef Hash). And while It isn’t always&nbsp;<strong>pleasurable</strong>&nbsp;to have to learn English, it is certainly&nbsp;<strong>doable&nbsp;</strong>or at least&nbsp;<strong>manageable</strong>. There are 2 billion learners all over the world, after all. &nbsp;</p><p>And, after reading this blog, you are one of them.
