Of course with the high-class, cultured reputation also comes the view that West London is trendy and pretentious.</li><li><strong>South London</strong>, like the east, is both rough and up and coming; like the North, it is also viewed as especially family-friendly and suburban (and dull).</li><li><strong>North London</strong> is also apparently the intellectual part of town. The area – which has been home to Stephen Fry, Geri Halliwell and Michael Foot – is cultured, but past its prime.</li></ul><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/London20Compass9-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnaGiEc3nTmqOeZZakwrN5wqKrop2j</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
