The team, and the city of Wrexham, have taken centre stage on their famous owners’ social media accounts, sparking interest in the club from millions of people around the world. This initial intrigue was cemented by a globally-streamed documentary, </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Welcome to Wrexham</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, which delved into the story of the club’s history and the start of its newest chapter.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>All of a sudden, big companies were vying to sponsor the team, the sold-out crowds returned and Hollywood legends like Will Ferrel (</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Anchorman</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Elf</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>) and Hugh Jackman (</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>X-Men, The Greatest Showman</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>) started showing up to watch games.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This excitement swirling around the club was matched by an uptick in performances on the pitch, resulting in </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=#><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>the men’s team winning promotion into the fully-professional fourth division</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> during the 2022/23 season. The Hollywood owners were in the stands for the occasion and were caught on video (by none other than actor Paul Rudd!) looking overwhelmed at the final whistle, before taking to the pitch to join in the riotous celebrations. During the same season, the women’s team tasted success too, winning promotion to the top league for women's football in Wales.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>And the success just kept on coming. In a remarkable feat, the men’s team secured a second successive promotion during the 2023/24 season, sending them up into the third division – a dizzying climb in such a short amount of time.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>But even before these milestones were achieved on the pitch, it was clear supporters had formed a special bond with their club’s new owners, who have bathed the city and community in love and respect since purchasing the team. The pair endeavour to attend as many home matches as they can, and are regularly spotted sharing a beer with fans in local pub, The Turf, after matches.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Where this fairytale story leads remains to be seen. But, while many may have initially dismissed the team’s celebrity takeover as something of a joke, it’s Ryan, Rob and the city of Wrexham who are certainly having the last laugh.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifLe10qKraKugpL%2B1e9arnLGgkaJ6qLvErGShp5yhxri7zp0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
