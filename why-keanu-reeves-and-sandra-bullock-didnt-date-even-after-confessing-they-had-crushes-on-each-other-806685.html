Their on-screen chemistry left&nbsp;us swooning over the fictional couple, praising their acting skills. However, years later, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> that both of&nbsp;them had crushes on&nbsp;each other and made&nbsp;us realize that their chemistry was actually not only good acting, but something more.</p><p>When we&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> found out about this, we&nbsp;wondered why this duo never coupled up&nbsp;and used our detective skills to&nbsp;learn more about their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>.</p><h2>Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves co-starred as&nbsp;love interests in&nbsp;2&nbsp;movies, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Speed</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Lake House</i></a>.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c3/15c/1c40eb5c059033fbf31b7967a6.jpg><p>Reeves and Bullock weren’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>purposely</a> picked for the roles of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Annie</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jack Traven</a> in&nbsp;<i>Speed</i>. But after rehearsing physical <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scenes</a> together at&nbsp;the audition to&nbsp;test their chemistry, the director chose the duo for the film, for which they won <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Best On-Screen Duo</a> at&nbsp;the 1995&nbsp;MTV Movie Awards. Whether it&nbsp;was destiny that played its part here or&nbsp;not, we’ll never know, but this kick-started a&nbsp;decades-long <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> between Bullock and Reeves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d22/348/06d76e5982972f14b04d06045a.jpg><p>12&nbsp;years later, the duo reunited in&nbsp;the movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Lake House</i></a>, and the chemistry between them was still undeniable. When Reeves was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> what was it&nbsp;like to&nbsp;work again with Bullock, he&nbsp;replied, “I&nbsp;can’t explain in&nbsp;words why Sandra and&nbsp;I have chemistry on-screen or&nbsp;why we&nbsp;work well together. We&nbsp;just&nbsp;do, and I’m glad because&nbsp;I like her tremendously as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person.”</p><p>Bullock shared the same feelings for Reeves as&nbsp;well. “I&nbsp;am glad to&nbsp;work with him again. I&nbsp;don’t know what it&nbsp;is, but&nbsp;I love being around Keanu. I&nbsp;really&nbsp;do. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;such a&nbsp;good person.”</p><p><h2>Their off-screen bond was also strong.</h2></p><p>Reeves and Bullock are not only colleagues but <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>friends</a> too. From time to&nbsp;time, they have dinners together to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;on&nbsp;everything going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;each other’s lives. Bullock also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that over the years, she wrote Keanu letters to&nbsp;ask him how he&nbsp;was doing.</p><p>How strong their bond is&nbsp;was proven once more when Reeves helped present Bullock with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Decade of&nbsp;Hotness</a>" award at&nbsp;Spike TV’s Guys Choice Awards and gave a&nbsp;speech that moved her to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tears</a>. “Sandra, your heart, your soul, your light, your talent that you share with all of&nbsp;us is&nbsp;amazing and wonderful and extraordinary. You are one of&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind!”</p><p><h2>They didn’t know they BOTH had crushes on&nbsp;each other.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2e/fc3/c93f775a8f9862749e0cbca855.jpg><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview in&nbsp;2018, 25&nbsp;years after Bullock and Reeves first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a>, the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that she had a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;Reeves when they filmed <i>Speed</i> and gushed over him. “I&nbsp;think about how sweet Keanu Reeves was and how handsome he&nbsp;was.” She was so&nbsp;head over hills for him that she would giggle every time he&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;her.</p><p>However, neither Reeves nor Bullock pulled strings to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together, and in&nbsp;Bullock’s opinion, it&nbsp;was because there was something about her that Reeves didn’t like.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/273/891/a5a3eb5c3391abd644af6421e6.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, when Reeves saw a&nbsp;recording of&nbsp;Bullock talking about her feelings for him, he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea she had a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;him. At&nbsp;that moment, Reeves revealed that he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;her too and that she probably didn’t know it&nbsp;either, and the reason he&nbsp;didn’t try to&nbsp;date her was that they were working together.</p><p><h2>Bullock suspects that getting together would have ruined a&nbsp;great friendship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e2/d39/21f1e65497a11b2ba2d48c66e4.jpg><p>Bullock <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believes</a> that if&nbsp;she and Reeves had tried to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple at&nbsp;some point, their relationship wouldn’t have survived. “Keanu’s a&nbsp;guy who, I&nbsp;feel like, is&nbsp;friends with every woman he’s ever dated. I&nbsp;don’t think there’s anyone who has something horrible to&nbsp;say about him.”</p><p>But their relationship didn’t have to&nbsp;survive anything, and Bullock believes it’s for the best. “We&nbsp;just get to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;together on&nbsp;parallel roads and tip our hats and meet for a&nbsp;dinner and try to&nbsp;work together. And the longer time goes&nbsp;on, the more in&nbsp;awe I&nbsp;am of&nbsp;the human being.”</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves’ relationship would’ve survived if&nbsp;they started <a href=# title=dating data-link=tag>dating</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyknJqmpWK%2FprHVnqpmmZ6ZerStzZ2pmmWSqrmtu8KkZJ2hlKPBbrDArZxmnaaau26txa2cq2WTpLunsdKsoKefXam1psWMoZidZZOnwrS0xKxkqKZdmq6ktIyoq6GdomKFcYKVcWxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
