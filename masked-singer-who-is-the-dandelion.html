She says her life has always felt like a movie, “The Wizard of Oz to be exact.” Like Judy Garland, she started her career when she was just. Kid. We see Dandelion on a “Wanted” poster. She claims she’s worked with all the greats, listing Madonna, Flea, and Sir Elton John. Dandelion also mentions “the living and the dead” as a zombie walks across the screen.</p><p>But she was “restless for a home,” a place to play her keys. We see one of the men in black wearing a halo and angel wings playing piano, then the zombie took a bite into a flower. So she put down some roots in a “musical city.” Another one of the men in black is holding an axe. But sadly, a “devastating twister” hit her home.&nbsp; But she rebuilt, she says as she picks an apple off a tree. Dandelion closes her clues walking toward the Emerald City, hand-in-hand with two men in black.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ MACAW?

Nicole said it “could be” Zooey Deschanel. But Jenny picked up on other clues, predicting Emmy Rossum. Nicole didn’t think this is her voice though. Ken knew “EXACTLY who this is,” guessing Reese Witherspoon is the Dandelion. His prediction was met with boo’s from the other judges and the audience.</p><p>Online, there’s no consensus on who this is! Many fans have guessed Vanessa Williams, Diana Ross, and Annie Lennox. But it seems pretty clear that viewers aren’t in line with the judges’ predictions (especially Ken’s).</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ CALIFORNIA ROLL?

And that is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alicia Witt!</h2><p>Despite many fans in the comment being 100% confident that this is Vanessa Williams, the clues just don’t line up! Let’s see how they all fit with Alciia Witt.</p><p>Dandelion mentioned that started her career when she was just a kid and Alicia was on a reality show called That’s Incredible when she was only 5. The “Wanted” poster could be a nod to her recurring role on Law & Order: Criminal Intent. She claimed to work with Madonna, Flea, and Sir Elton John, and she’s been in shows or movies with each one: Four Rooms, Gen13, and Nashville, respectively. The zombie in her clues is pointing to another one of her TV roles on The Walking Dead.</p><p>The Dandelion mentioned wanting to find “a place to play her keys” and Alicia Witt played piano growing up, even competing nationally. She talked about “putting down roots in a musical city,” referencing Nashville where she lives now and also the show of the same name that she has appeared on. Some more clues about her previous roles include the halo and angel wings, referring to Cowgirls ‘n Angels, and an axe, referring to Urban Legend. The “devastating twister” that hit her home was an outbreak of tornadoes that took place in Nashville in March 2020.&nbsp; Finally, her clue about the Billboard charts and being next to Olivia Rodrigo perfectly tracks for Alicia Witt! Her single, Chasing Shadows, appeared on the same Billboard chart ion 2021, according to her <a href=#>Instagram post</a> at the time.</p><p>But we won’t have confirmation until she’s unmasked later this season.
