So, if you were wondering how old is Diamond Platnumz wife, we have an answer for you. Diamond Platnumz wife age is 38 years old.</p><p class=align-left>She was born in the family of Nasur Hassan and Halima Hassan, her mother has unfortunately passed away. The most of Zari’s childhood was spent in Jinja, Uganda. Her father is half Somali half Burundian, while her mother was of Indian and Ugandan origin. So, Zari’s heritage is mixed. Zari was not the only child in her family – she had seven siblings: five sisters and two brothers.</p><p class=align-left>Zari attended the primary school in her native city Jinja. She took her A-levels and obtained high school diploma at the Jinja Girls High School. After completing her school education, Zari went on to study at the UK’s Cosmetology School of Girls in London, where she was trained to become a beautician and gained yet another diploma. She is a skin care specialist with a degree.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c395f4dd11517e5d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top facts about Agbani Darego's baby and husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A lot of people are wondering whether Zari has bleached her own skin to fit in her high and luxurious lifestyle, even though she denies these claims. Another thing that people have always been wondering about is her lips – some are certain that she did a lip augmentation, just like Kylie Jenner and many other celebrities. It is also known that she wears braces to take care of her teeth. However, no matter what people say, Zari knows that she is a public person who will be a target of gossips anyway, and is certain that she is the only one in charge of her appearance.</p><p class=align-left>Zari Hassan has always wished to become a popular singer. Back in school, she started developing her singing talent. When she entered high school, she already had very high singing skills, which allowed her to participate in different music and dancing competitions, as well as drama clubs. She won the best actress title twice. 2007 was the year when young Zari recorded and released her debut single “Oliwage”. This song has earned her a “Best East African Video of the Year” nomination at the Channel O Awards ceremony, which was held in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/396a03e34719ac9e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sani Abacha's family: everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2009, Zari won the “Diaspora” award of the year at the Diva Awards ceremony. Zari Hassan’s music creations were strongly inspired by the worldwide famous singers Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. As for the local musicians, Zari always looked up to Brenda Fassie, Miriam Makeba, Yvonne Chaka Chaka, and Lucky Dube.</p><p class=align-left>Diamond Platnumz was not the first husband of Zari. In 2000, when she completed her degree in the United Kingdom, after two years abroad she first returned to her native country Uganda and then relocated to South Africa. This is where she met her former husband, Ivan Semwanga, the South-African socialite born in Uganda. Ivan was a member of the Rich Gang group, which was well-known in Uganda and South Africa. This group helped the less privileged young people, mostly those from Uganda who resided in South Africa.</p><p class=align-left>Zari and Ivan were married for twelve years. They had three sons together, whose names are Pinto, Quincy, and Didy. The happiness ended in 2013 when the couple grew apart.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ffa6c76a2e001bf2_w.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>You will never believe how much Rita Dominic is worth!</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f39f96d6bbf98777.jpg><p class=align-left>Zari and her ex-husband Ivan. Photo: sde.co.ke</p><p class=align-left>She then moved on to the new relationship – in 2014, she met her latest husband, Diamond Platnumz (or Naseeb Abdul Juma, which is his real name). They met by accident, and Zari even asked for a picture with Diamond, as she was a huge fan of him. As they met on their journey to Uganda, they had a chance to have a conversation. After this meeting, they would occasionally hang out together and post photos. They officially confirmed their romantic relationship in late 2014.</p><p class=align-left>Diamond was nine years younger than Zari, but the age difference did not stop the couple from being completely head over heels with each other. Their marriage was blessed with two children – Latifah Dangote, who was born in August 2015, and Prince Nillan, whose birthday was in December 2016. During the time they were married, Zari managed to alternate between Tanzania and South Africa, as well as her husband Diamond Platnumz.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0c759673761a30c6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nadia Buari's biography: age, parents, husband, children, net worth</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c395f4dd11517e5d.jpg><p class=align-left>Zari and Diamond. Photo: mpasho.co.ke</p><p class=align-left>In May 2017, Zari was taken aback by the sudden tragic news. Her former husband, Ivan Semwanga, suffered a stroke and was admitted to the Steve Biko Academic hospital in a very difficult state. Zari had to come and take care of him in his final moments before he slipped into a coma and passed away.</p><p class=align-left>Ivan Semwanga, the ex-husband of Zari and father of her three children, was buried in Uganda. Zari attended the funeral together with her older sons. After the funeral, she came back to South Africa to manage her late husband’s businesses and some of her own enterprises. By the way, only two months after her ex-husband’s death, her mother fell sick and also passed away, so 2017 was a truly difficult year for Zari Hassan.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Most successful entrepreneurs in Nigeria in 2018</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/396a03e34719ac9e.jpeg><p class=align-left>Zari Hassan and her sons during her ex-husband's funeral.

However, their relationship officially hit rock bottom in 2018. No one knows exactly when things went downhill, but the fact was that Diamond and Zari could no longer be a couple. The interesting fact was that Zari actually broke up with her husband on Valentine’s Day 2018. She deleted their photos from her Instagram and did not attend to his birthday party.</p><p class=align-left>When Zari explained her decision to separate from Diamond, she said that she actually broke up with him because there were constant rumors in the media about him cheating on her.
