Whether it’s making unfunny jokes or criticizing contestants, Mandel has had some awkward, embarrassing, and controversial moments that have been caught on camera.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-howie-mandel-s-worst-moments-on-america-s-got-talent>Howie Mandel’s Worst Moments on America’s Got Talent</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mandel-buzzes-mother-son-duo>Mandel Buzzes Mother, Son Duo</h3><p>During Season 11 of AGT, Mandel’s worst moment came when he buzzed Alla and Daniel, a mother and son dancing duo, during their quarterfinals performance. However, in a surprising turn of events, Alla’s other two children auditioned for Season 16, where Mandel offered a full <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">apology</a> to the family, providing closure to the buzz incident.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mandel Undermines 12 Years of Hard Work by Dance Group</h3><p>In a disheartening moment, Mandel questioned the significance of the group’s 12 years of hard work, stating, “I don’t really understand what the 12 years of work was.” This happened during season 17 of AGT, when Japanese dance group MPlusPlus performed a captivating routine to Coldplay’s “Higher Power.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mandel Criticized a Grandfather, Granddaughter Act</h3><p>During Season 16 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a>, a heartfelt performance by the tap dancing duo Gramps and Maeve took a disappointing turn when Mandel criticized their act. The grandfather and granddaughter showcased their talent and joyful connection on stage, aiming for a chance at the million-dollar prize.</p><p>However, Mandel dismissed their performance as more fitting for a talent show recital rather than a million-dollar act. This moment stands as one of Mandel’s worst moments on Got Talent, as he failed to recognize the emotional connection and the ability of a performance to touch hearts beyond flashy spectacle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mandel Makes a Controversial AGT: The Champions Elimination</h3><p>In a surprising turn of events during the first episode of AGT: The Champions, Mandel faced backlash from fans over his decision in the Judges’ Choice. The three acts vying for a spot in the semifinals were shadow dance group Junior Creative, singer Jack Vidgen, and accordion player Hans. While Klum voted for Hans and Alesha Dixon supported Junior Creative, it came down to Mandel’s deciding vote. Much to the disappointment of many viewers, Mandel chose Hans to move forward.</p><p>Fans expressed their outrage on Twitter, questioning why Junior Creative’s emotional performance, which portrayed a poignant tale of a war-torn family, was overlooked. It’s worth noting that Mandel has always been known to favor comic acts, and his decision may have been influenced by his preference for such performances.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mandel Makes a Controversial Bulimia Joke on AGT</h3><p>During a live episode of AGT, Mandel found himself in hot water after making a joke about bulimia while commenting on contestant Stevie Starr, known as “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Regurgitator</a>.”</p><p>This would probably come out wrong, but you, sir, make bulimia entertaining.” Mandel said.</p><p>The comment received significant backlash on social media, prompting Mandel to issue an apology later in the show.
