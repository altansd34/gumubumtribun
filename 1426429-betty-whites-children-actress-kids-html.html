He was born to Margaret and Allen Ludden in 1948 before Allen's marriage to Betty. David leads a quiet, low-profile life as an Asian History professor at New York University.</p><p class=align-left>Ludden got his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania and has since won multiple awards for his accomplishments in the field of history. After graduating, David landed his first teaching role handling South Asian history, which he held until 2007.</p><p class=align-left>Besides teaching, Ludden has also written several versions of a book known as <i><a href=# rel=noopener>India</a> and South Asia: A Short History.</i> He is a holder of the renowned Guggenheim Fellowship for Humanities Award.</p><h3>Martha Ludden</h3><p class=align-left>Martha Ludden is probably the best known of Betty's step-kids. This is due to Martha and Betty's somewhat controversial relationship after the latter's marriage to Allen.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/afcdbe3cbdc86541.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katia Washington’s biography: who is Denzel Washington’s daughter?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Martha was born in 1950 and was quite young when her father married the <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1424299-angeline-appels-biography-age-ethnicity-partner-career.html? href=#>famous actress</a>. Reports have it that Martha did not take the news of her father's remarriage very well. Being a teen at the time, Martha is said to have harboured anger towards her stepmother and was quite clearly opposed to the marriage.</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, Martha's relationship with her own father was also far from rosy. It is said that Allen would constantly argue with his daughter over her anger towards his new wife. The strained father-daughter relationship reportedly caused Allen inexplicable grief.</p><p class=align-left>Martha Ludden got her Law Degree in 1990 and currently works with people with varying disabilities. With time, Betty White's relationship with her stepkids, and Martha in particular, did improve significantly.</p><h3>Sarah Ludden</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4297c3ebfcb9b5df.jpg><p class=align-left>Sarah is the last born of Allen Ludden's children.

She now runs a karate school called Thousand Waves which she co-founded with her business partner, Nancy Lanoue.</p><h2>Who was Betty White's husband?</h2><p class=align-left>The actress was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married three times</a>. Here are details about Betty White's husbands.</p><h3>Barker</h3><p class=align-left>Betty and Barker got married in 1945. The two met while Betty was working with the American Women's Voluntary Service. The two were engaged for most of <a href=#>World</a> War II but did not last long after the war was over.</p><p class=align-left>Betty's life was significantly different from that of Barker, a chicken farmer from Ohio. The marriage ended a short while after the end of World War II.</p><h3>Lane Allen</h3><p class=align-left>The actress got married again in 1949, this time to Lane Allen. Her second husband wanted her to let go of her career and focus on raising a family. Betty was opposed to the stay-at-home idea. The marriage ended in 1951.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/90526c9aba36c0bd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kayla Compton’s biography: age, height, movies and tv shows</span></p></a><h3>Allen Ludden</h3><p class=align-left>Ludden and Betty met when the latter appeared on the renowned game show<i> Password.</i> Allen is said to have fallen in love with Betty when he saw her. At first, Betty resisted Ludden's advances since she did not see a <a href=#>future</a> for herself in her then-current city, New York.</p><p class=align-left>Two years after their first meeting, Betty and Ludden finally got married. Unfortunately, Betty's husband from her third marriage succumbed to a stomach ailment in 1981.

The reason for her demise was announced as natural causes. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">funeral arrangements</a> were kept private to honour the late actress's wishes.</p><h2>Who are Betty White's heirs?</h2><p class=align-left>Since the actress did not have any biological children of her own, and her husband Allen Ludden passed away about three decades ago, Betty does not have any <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">legal heirs</a> to inherit her.
