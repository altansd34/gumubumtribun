Three years later, during Elizabeth’s wedding to the Duke of Edinburgh, Susan was reputedly hidden away in her wedding carriage so the dog could be a part of the big day – even accompanying the royal couple on their honeymoon.</p><p>From Susan, Elizabeth bred dozens of corgis throughout her life, as well as dachshund-crosses, known as "dorgis". The dogs were beloved pets and said to live a life of luxury, sleeping in pillow-lined wicker baskets in their own dedicated room of the palace – with meals, including fresh rabbit, prepared by the Royal kitchen staff.</p><p>Due to the constant presence of corgis at Elizabeth’s side throughout her reign, the breed has become a symbol of the modern <a href=#>British royal family</a>, appearing on coins, featuring in statues, and adorning mountains of souvenir mugs.</p><p>The royal corgis have also become the subject of a number of books and films, as well as making a star turn, alongside Daniel Craig as James Bond, in <a href=#>a notable sketch that featured as part of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Summer Olympics</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifKKuzq6raK%2BVocCpecKoqaCho2KwprjEm6marJmjtG65zqyrZp6Rory2v4ydpqBlp5a5pr8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
