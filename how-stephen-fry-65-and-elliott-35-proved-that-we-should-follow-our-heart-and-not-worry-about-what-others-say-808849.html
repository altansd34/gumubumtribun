However, Stephen Fry’s love life had been less busy than his professional one.</p><p>The Englishman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>struggled</a> with finding happiness in&nbsp;his personal life for years, thinking that love was for ’’other people.’’ In&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;keep his homosexuality hidden, which was complicated, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;made the decision to&nbsp;go&nbsp;celibate at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;22&nbsp;in&nbsp;1979, and he&nbsp;remained that way for 16&nbsp;years. He&nbsp;later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that his abstinence was, in&nbsp;fact, the result of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;personal confidence.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a24/a0b/52c3915fc89d25a7fd4d267eb9.jpg><p>ANTHONY HARVEY/SIPA/EAST NEWS</p><p>But things changed for him at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;38&nbsp;when Stephan finally found <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>love</a> with someone who he&nbsp;said ’’saved’’ him. The young man was Daniel Cohen, a&nbsp;former makeup and vitamin salesman who was 12&nbsp;years younger than him. The couple stayed together for 14&nbsp;years.</p><p>When he&nbsp;was later asked whether he&nbsp;regrets having avoided romantic activity for more than a&nbsp;decade and a&nbsp;half of&nbsp;his life, Stephan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>answered</a>, ’’I don’t regret the celibacy, no.

We&nbsp;laugh all the time.” It&nbsp;was obvious that the 2&nbsp;artists were a&nbsp;match made in&nbsp;heaven, and they decided to&nbsp;make their love official by&nbsp;getting married in&nbsp;2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/068/749/63315e5386b7e868134311cbba.jpg><p>However, their 30-year age gap didn’t leave people indifferent.
