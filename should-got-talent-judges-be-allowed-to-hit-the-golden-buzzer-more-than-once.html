America’s Got Talent, meanwhile, has also introduced a group Golden Buzzer, adding up to six per season.</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell has teased</a> that this season of BGT will feature a whopping eight Golden Buzzers. It all started when new judge Bruno Tonioli, unaware of the show’s rules, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hit the Golden Buzzer</a> a second time. Cowell ended up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">following his lead</a>, and promos for this season have also teased <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the show’s first group Golden Buzzer</a>.</p><p>Obviously, the choice to allow extra Golden Buzzers got people talking. However, by the time the pre-taped episodes actually aired, news of Tonioli and Cowell’s rule-breaking had already spread online. So it wasn’t quite as exciting or surprising to see it happen on screen. At this point, viewers are just waiting for what they already know will happen.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘BRITAIN’S GOT TALENT’ SERIES 16 KICKS OFF WITH TWO GOLDEN BUZZERS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-should-more-golden-buzzers-be-allowed>Should More Golden Buzzers Be Allowed?</h2><p>BGT‘s extra Golden Buzzers have us wondering if Got Talent shows should allow the judges to give the honor to more than one act each season. Although it’s great to see more talented people receiving their Golden Buzzer moment, I personally think it’s better to limit it.</p><p>If every judge, plus the hosts, had hit the Golden Buzzer twice this season, there would be 11 of them total. The more Golden Buzzers you have, the less meaningful they become. It also means that the Golden Buzzer acts will take up a larger percentage of the Semifinals, which makes it harder for other acts to make it through and takes away some of the suspense.</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t mean the judges won’t decide to break the rules in the future. But it won’t be long before the novelty of extra Golden Buzzers wears off for a lot of viewers. The rarer the honor is, the more fun it is to wonder who will receive it.</p><p>What do you think? Should the judges and hosts get more than one Golden Buzzer each? Should there be a limit at all? Are you glad Tonioli and Cowell broke the rules this year?
