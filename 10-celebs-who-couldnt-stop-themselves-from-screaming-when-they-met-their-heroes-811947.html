They appear to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;perfect that fans can scream and cry when seeing them, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems impossible. The funny thing is&nbsp;that some celebrities proved that they are as&nbsp;<a href=#>susceptible</a> to&nbsp;having idols as&nbsp;any of&nbsp;us, and their reactions to&nbsp;meeting them are priceless.</p><p><h2>1. Adele and Dwayne Johnson</h2></p><p>The 2023 Grammys was full of&nbsp;surprises, but one of&nbsp;the best moments of&nbsp;the evening was when host Trevor Noah approached <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Hello</i></a> singer <a href=# title=Adele data-link=tag>Adele</a> and revealed that he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;very special <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surprise</a> in&nbsp;store for her.</p><p>That detail turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nothing more and nothing less than <a href=#>introducing</a> her to&nbsp;her idol Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. In&nbsp;fact, the moment was even more emotional because, according to&nbsp;Trevor, Johnson has also been a&nbsp;big fan of&nbsp;the singer for a&nbsp;long time.</p><p>Thus, the stars starred in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tender scene where they showed their affection and admiration for each other.</p><p><h2>2. Sarah Paulson and Madonna</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2018, actress Sarah Paulson was caught on&nbsp;camera at&nbsp;the exact moment when she met one of&nbsp;her favorite singers, <a href=# title=Madonna data-link=tag>Madonna</a>. And her reaction was so&nbsp;funny that later, on&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i></a>, the actress had the opportunity to&nbsp;tell everything that was going through her mind at&nbsp;that instant.</p><p>It&nbsp;turns out that while Paulson was modeling for the cameras on&nbsp;the runway, she noticed that everything had gone silent from one moment to&nbsp;the next and that no&nbsp;one was taking pictures of&nbsp;her. That’s when she turned around and saw Madonna standing a&nbsp;few feet away, and she couldn’t help but be&nbsp;as&nbsp;shocked as&nbsp;the photographers were to&nbsp;see her.</p><p>After her photo went viral on&nbsp;social media, the singer herself uploaded the moment to&nbsp;her Twitter account with the caption, “Hahahahahaha. I&nbsp;love you, Sarah,” to&nbsp;which the actress could only comment, full of&nbsp;emotion: “She knows my&nbsp;name! It’s crazy. I&nbsp;mean, it’s Madonna!”</p><p><h2>3. Meryl Streep and Mark Ruffalo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3fe/fe3/caa3475db6834f90e411c7ea21.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2014, <a href=# title="Meryl Streep" data-link=tag>Meryl Streep</a>, who also appeared in&nbsp;the <a href=#><i>Iron Lady</i></a>, gave&nbsp;us one of&nbsp;the best moments in&nbsp;Talk Show history. While chatting with the show’s host, Graham Norton, about why she accepted her role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;witch in&nbsp;the movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Into The Woods</i></a>, Mark Ruffalo interrupted her to&nbsp;give her a&nbsp;compliment. In&nbsp;response, the actress grabbed Ruffalo and kissed him on&nbsp;the mouth.</p><p>The actor, in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shock</a>, could do&nbsp;nothing but cover his face with his hands, then raised them to&nbsp;the sky. While Streep only commented: “I’ve been waiting for an&nbsp;excuse to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that all night,” showing their mutual admiration for each other.</p><p><h2>4. Emily Blunt and <i>The BackStreet Boys</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb1/0d2/ad78e751c38ee10bfdacfbd9e9.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2019, when <a href=#>Emily Blunt</a> was a&nbsp;guest on&nbsp;<i>The Ellen Show</i>, the host, commenting on&nbsp;how well Emily sings, invited her on&nbsp;stage to&nbsp;perform a&nbsp;song. At&nbsp;first, the actress looked slightly disoriented, but that changed when it&nbsp;was revealed that behind the curtains was one of&nbsp;her favorite bands, The BackStreet Boys.</p><p>At&nbsp;that moment, Emily couldn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>help</a> but let her jaw drop and get as&nbsp;excited as&nbsp;the audience to&nbsp;see them, and after a&nbsp;warm greeting, Blunt performed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>I&nbsp;Want It&nbsp;That Way</i></a> alongside the singers.</p><p><h2>5. Camila Cabello and the <i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones </i>stars</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/488/cbe/1f693b5f86aff5801c0fe805ac.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2020, Camila Cabello was the happiest woman to&nbsp;have been invited to&nbsp;Graham Norton’s show. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;coincidence that the <a href=#>stars</a> of&nbsp;<i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i>, a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;which the singer admitted to&nbsp;being the #1&nbsp;fan, would be&nbsp;seated next to&nbsp;her.</p><p>When, after singing a&nbsp;song, Cabello was invited to&nbsp;sit with the other guests, she greeted Clarke by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>calling</a> her “my&nbsp;queen!” Then she commented on&nbsp;how excited she was to&nbsp;meet them and even mentioned that it&nbsp;would take her the rest of&nbsp;the year to&nbsp;recover from that feeling.</p><p><h2>6. Pink and Johnny Depp</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/080/ebc/961628567d93409a267adb188d.jpg><p>On&nbsp;the fourth season of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i></a><i> </i><a href=# title=Pink data-link=tag>Pink</a> was chatting with the host when, out of&nbsp;the blue, he&nbsp;casually asked her about that time when she met <a href=# title="Johnny Depp" data-link=tag>Johnny Depp</a> since the singer had mentioned that he&nbsp;and Michael Keaton are her platonic loves.</p><p>Pink answered calmly, saying it&nbsp;didn’t go&nbsp;as&nbsp;expected because her husband forced her to&nbsp;introduce herself. It&nbsp;was at&nbsp;that moment that, out of&nbsp;nowhere, Depp enters the stage, leaving the singer speechless and with nowhere to&nbsp;hide. Finally, Pink had no&nbsp;choice but to&nbsp;hug the actor and then sink into her seat, cringing with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>emotion</a>.</p><p><h2>7. Prince Harry and the<i> Spice Girls</i></h2></p><p>Prince Harry has never hidden he&nbsp;loves the Spice Girls. The Duke of&nbsp;Sussex is&nbsp;such a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;the group that he&nbsp;even invited them to&nbsp;sing at&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wedding</a> to&nbsp;Meghan Markle in&nbsp;2018.</p><p><h2>8. Taylor Swift and Justin Timberlake</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b9/412/2280065645a80ca773615ccf3b.jpg><p>Host Ellen DeGeneres is&nbsp;known for impressing her guests, sometimes with jokes and sometimes with nice moments. Taylor Swift was in&nbsp;for a&nbsp;pleasant surprise when DeGeneres introduced her to&nbsp;her longtime <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>crush</a>, Justin Timberlake. The singer was very excited and said: “This is&nbsp;the best day of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life,” after hugging the former member of&nbsp;the band NSYNC.</p><p><h2>9. Kelly Pickler and Clint Eastwood</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c78/557/929e0b55c2b7ed744490b81305.jpg><p>On&nbsp;another occasion, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>DeGeneres</a> surprised country singer Kelly Pickler right after the former <i>American Idol</i> contestant told her how much she loves <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Eastwood</a>, having grown up&nbsp;watching his movies. Then, the host announced who was coming, and Pickler couldn’t hold back a&nbsp;scream of&nbsp;excitement and then sat on&nbsp;the actor’s lap and hugged him, full of&nbsp;joy.</p><p><h2>10. Adele and Jennifer Aniston</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2014, the British singer was stunned to&nbsp;meet Jennifer Aniston on&nbsp;a&nbsp;red carpet in&nbsp;New York. But the funniest part of&nbsp;the meeting was revealed later on&nbsp;<i>The Graham Norton Show</i>.</p><p>The singer told <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>guests</a> that, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain point, they both went to&nbsp;the bathroom, and Adele <a href=# title=got data-link=tag>got</a> confused and called Aniston by&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;her character in&nbsp;<i>Friends</i>, Rachel. “Across the cubicle, she was like, ’How are you, honey?’ And I&nbsp;called her Rachel! I&nbsp;was like, ’Well, thank you, Rachel!’” the singer recalled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xecKeo56ao2LEqbuMnKaupJSjwW6%2F06inZqyYmrq0scuvnKxllqe8rnnSnKmemZ2eu6h51qGcp2WknbK6ecyeq2asmJq2s3nHnqmonaNihXJ9mG1uaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
