The plots aren’t even about the lovey-dovey stuff&nbsp;— instead, it’s action, <a href=# title=adventure data-link=tag>adventure</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=# title=comedy data-link=tag>comedy</a>. Nevertheless, these couples captured our attention so&nbsp;intensely that the main plot was left in&nbsp;the background.</p><p><h2>7. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger (<i>Harry Potter </i>series)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/67e/39a/cf3aa2557ca9c2cf53ebc88ddc.jpg><p>Their love was natural and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gradual</a>, it’s not like they were swept away by&nbsp;each other the minute they saw each other. They even disliked each other in&nbsp;the beginning. They are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opposites</a>, but according to&nbsp;the law of&nbsp;attraction, they end up&nbsp;together. Sorry, Hermione-Harry fans!</p><ul><li>Ron and Hermione have realistic love. <a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a> isn’t a&nbsp;romance-fueled series, but this was the best side plot. Even though they didn’t kiss after 200&nbsp;pages, there was subtlety.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Unknown author&nbsp;/ thetoptens</a></li></ul><ul><li>What makes this couple so&nbsp;special is&nbsp;their romance plot expands over 7&nbsp;years, not a&nbsp;fake 7&nbsp;years but a&nbsp;real one along with the actor and actress as&nbsp;they grow&nbsp;up. It&nbsp;made it&nbsp;so&nbsp;real and gave their love great depth.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Unknown author&nbsp;/ thetoptens</a></li></ul><p><h2>6. Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (<i>Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean</i>)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e3a/e56/16558d598bb7219753f3310523.jpg><p>Will and Elizabeth’s relationship is&nbsp;unlike any other. They first met when Elizabeth found Will floating in&nbsp;the open sea. Their love story has never been straightforward. It&nbsp;seems like they faced <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>challenges</a> that tried to&nbsp;keep them apart every step of&nbsp;the way. However, they overcame all obstacles and proved their love was strong and enduring.</p><ul><li>This couple makes me&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;strongly for them! Every time&nbsp;I think about them, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;cry because of&nbsp;all the cruelty and unfairness they experienced. They’re so&nbsp;beautiful together and have such chemistry. They fought so&nbsp;hard protecting each other. All they wanted&nbsp;— was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly created wonderful characters! I&nbsp;hate the ending! Disney, bring them back and set things right!<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Unknown author&nbsp;/ thetoptens</a></li></ul><ul><li>Despite all Will and Elizabeth went through. They still stayed together. Elizabeth was willing to&nbsp;wait 10&nbsp;years for him! From childhood to&nbsp;adulthood. They were loyal. Elizabeth defied society to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with Will. They rock!<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Unknown author&nbsp;/ thetoptens</a></li></ul><p><h2>5. Peter Parker and Mary Jane (<i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/424/b29/2b8b34512db5c0581d66d70918.jpg><p>The relationship can be&nbsp;described as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>awkward</a>, shy, and a&nbsp;bit uncomfortable, but still cute. It&nbsp;makes sense because the characters are teens. They support each other despite having lots of&nbsp;struggles and disappointments. They both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mature,</a> and their development is&nbsp;impressive.</p><ul><li>Personally, I&nbsp;didn’t feel like there was a&nbsp;single moment where it&nbsp;was too over the top, which makes me&nbsp;really happy. They had some good moments, and this&nbsp;MJ felt like the one we&nbsp;know from the comics with how she’s always in&nbsp;Peter’s corner and is&nbsp;there to&nbsp;support him, and accepts “the life” that comes with him being <a href=# title=Spider-Man data-link=tag>Spider-Man</a>.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The-Dovah&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>People say they don’t see the beginning for them, but&nbsp;I think it’s pretty obvious&nbsp;MJ has a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;Peter in&nbsp;homecoming. Not to&nbsp;mention that they are teenagers. Love happens fast for teenagers.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>WhateverIWant888&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>4. John and Jane (<i>Mr.&nbsp;&&nbsp;Mrs. Smith</i>)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c49/f82/7dbf9c552e89c702cc37eed311.jpg><p>Although the main characters had a&nbsp;stormy relationship and had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;marriage counseling, the chemistry between the 2&nbsp;still <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>impressed </a>viewers. The 2&nbsp;have very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>different</a> personalities, and a&nbsp;dramatic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recovery</a> from monotony is&nbsp;what develops the story in&nbsp;the most entertaining way.</p><ul><li>When I&nbsp;saw the movie, I&nbsp;was young and had never seen either of&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them in&nbsp;anything at&nbsp;all and didn’t even know their names. But I&nbsp;did know they were fantastic together.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lyfultruth&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>3. Baby Houseman and Johnny Castle (<i>Dirty Dancing</i>)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e76/339/f59a66505fba9fea4884bec79e.jpg><p>Take 2&nbsp;stunning people like Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze, add some steamy dance moves, and you’ve got a&nbsp;movie (and a&nbsp;couple) that will be&nbsp;forever ingrained in&nbsp;our memories. The magnetic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dancing</a> and risking everything for love make the movie especially captivating.</p><ul><li><i>Dirty Dancing</i> is&nbsp;the definition of&nbsp;on-screen chemistry. Re-watching it&nbsp;really emphasizes how sanitized and cold, so&nbsp;many contemporary movie couples are.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>abirdofthesky&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>The romantic story is&nbsp;realistic and very much encapsulates a&nbsp;true summer fling. Jennifer Grey is&nbsp;not the typical ‘pretty’ main female character. The underlying theme of&nbsp;the class structure is&nbsp;truly a&nbsp;game-changer for me&nbsp;too. The whole movie speaks to&nbsp;you on&nbsp;some level, no&nbsp;matter who you are.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Precariousme183&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>2. Gomez and Morticia Addams (<i>The Addams Family</i>)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/797/16c/e701045510868beda5f80997ee.jpg><p>Gomez and Morticia are one of&nbsp;the most romantic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>couples</a>. They have that gothic vibe going on&nbsp;and represent everything you want to&nbsp;include in&nbsp;a&nbsp;love story. Their love is&nbsp;intense, and they’re incredibly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>loyal</a> to&nbsp;each other. Besides, they’re great at&nbsp;communicating with each other, which makes their relationship even stronger.</p><ul><li>Let’s be&nbsp;real here. These 2&nbsp;were amazing together, and since I’ve watched their movies, I&nbsp;have wanted a&nbsp;relationship as&nbsp;perfect, though perhaps not as&nbsp;morbid, as&nbsp;theirs. They just bounce off each other so&nbsp;well.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lyfultruth&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>1. Sebastian and Mia (<i>La&nbsp;La&nbsp;Land</i>)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/44b/e38/b2a1a0500cbc407ffe321beed4.jpg><p>Sebastian and Mia’s relationship is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most mature love stories. That’s why so&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>many</a> people <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>consider</a> them one of&nbsp;the best couples. The characters are both into music, and they click really well. They both give each other enough space to&nbsp;pursue their passions and cheer each other&nbsp;up. It&nbsp;ended on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sour note, but that’s what makes the relationship so&nbsp;fascinating.</p><ul><li>The ending just kinda made their relationship in&nbsp;the movie way more interesting/heartbreaking.
