First, in&nbsp;case someone forgets to&nbsp;close the tap the <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a> won’t overflow, and the bathroom won’t get flooded. Second,<strong> </strong>thanks to&nbsp;that hole the water drains faster as&nbsp;it&nbsp;gives an&nbsp;escape for the air helping the water flow down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/899/514/9f3b865e17b7cca68e7667f3e3.png><p>Those two holes on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;any Converse shoe are there not only to&nbsp;let the stinky air out. Sure, breathability is&nbsp;important for any athlete. The second reason is&nbsp;that athletes lace through those holes to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;better grip.</p><p>Donuts have a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the middle, and it&nbsp;doesn’t stand for&nbsp;O in&nbsp;Donut! It’s not designed for an&nbsp;easier grip either (though it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;quite convenient!). It’s actually made this way for mass baking so&nbsp;that they cook all the way through evenly.</p><p>Most metallic zippers have a&nbsp;hidden lock inside them to&nbsp;save you from awkward situations such as&nbsp;an&nbsp;undone fly. Oh&nbsp;boy. Don’t leave the zipper handle in&nbsp;an&nbsp;upward position. When you pull it&nbsp;downwards, it&nbsp;automatically locks. It’s all thanks to&nbsp;those tiny grooves hidden underneath the handle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ace/92a/b673605437b639b68b2a8d59b1.png><p>Almost any public toilet has a&nbsp;large gap between the floor and the door. The reason for such a&nbsp;zero privacy thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;actually minimize the level of&nbsp;privacy and comfort so&nbsp;that people wouldn’t stay there long and there’d be&nbsp;no&nbsp;lines. It’s also easier to&nbsp;clean and safer if&nbsp;some <a href=# title=emergency data-link=tag>emergency</a> occurs.</p><p>Spoiled milk emits gases (like most foods when they go&nbsp;bad). A&nbsp;classic plastic milk jug has a&nbsp;concave shape on&nbsp;one side. So&nbsp;when the gases expand inside the jug, it&nbsp;expands too, and the concave shape curves out. Also, if&nbsp;you wanna save some milk for later and freeze&nbsp;it, the jug will expand when the milk gets solid as&nbsp;well, occupying more space in&nbsp;a&nbsp;jug.</p><p>Headrests in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a> are about comfort, and detachable headrests are about safety. If&nbsp;you pull the headrest out of&nbsp;the seat you’ll see two bars, which are quite sturdy. If&nbsp;you ever get locked or&nbsp;trapped in&nbsp;a&nbsp;car, you can get out of&nbsp;there smashing the window with these bars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/800/bb2/54e794502cbf53dc386038a21e.png><p>Bath foam isn’t only for fun or&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice smell&nbsp;— it&nbsp;also helps regulate the temperature. The bubbles keep the water hot, so&nbsp;you can enjoy a&nbsp;bath for a&nbsp;bit longer. Anyway, it&nbsp;works for acrylic<strong> </strong>bathtubs only&nbsp;— those made of&nbsp;metal lose heat really fast either way.</p><p>Many cups and mugs have little grooves on&nbsp;the bottom on&nbsp;purpose. They’re designed for dishwashing machines. The grooves let the water flow and not spill over your feet when you take the cup out. Also, those grooves let the air flow, so&nbsp;the cup doesn’t crack even if&nbsp;the tea is&nbsp;scalding!</p><p>Almost all measuring tapes have a&nbsp;metal tip with a&nbsp;small slot on&nbsp;the end. You can use this slot to&nbsp;hang the tape on&nbsp;a&nbsp;nail or&nbsp;a&nbsp;screw to&nbsp;make measurements without anyone’s help. Sometimes this tip has a&nbsp;row of&nbsp;sharp points along the edge on&nbsp;one side. That comes in&nbsp;handy when you wanna leave a&nbsp;mark without using a&nbsp;pencil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/984/2f1/e16887511ebe989dc54ae2dc9c.png><p>Doorknobs are usually made of&nbsp;<strong>brass</strong>, <strong>bronze</strong>, and some other <strong>copper </strong>alloys for a&nbsp;reason. They have an&nbsp;antibacterial effect, so&nbsp;they stop microbes from spreading. They get rid of&nbsp;a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;harmful germs pretty fast&nbsp;— within a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours. But don’t forget to&nbsp;wash your hands anyway<strong>!</strong></p><p>Grocery carts have loops for a&nbsp;reason. You don’t wanna put your jacket in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cart next to&nbsp;potatoes and onions. Hang it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;loop. This little hook-like thing is&nbsp;here to&nbsp;help you better organize the space in&nbsp;your cart. The carts also have a&nbsp;super handy grid.</p><p>Whenever the cart’s full, you just need to&nbsp;lift the grid and attach the shopping basket for extra purchases, placing it&nbsp;in&nbsp;between the horizontal bar above the wheels and the hooks the grid has. A&nbsp;point on&nbsp;an&nbsp;ointment cap is&nbsp;there for a&nbsp;reason, too. Most tubes are usually sealed with foil, and it’s better to&nbsp;avoid opening it&nbsp;with your fingers unless you’re ready to&nbsp;say goodbye to&nbsp;your nails. A&nbsp;point easily opens even the most safely sealed tube.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e12/644/a89ac55d1e9419be154ab3a63f.png><p>A&nbsp;pack of&nbsp;cotton pads has those strings on&nbsp;it&nbsp;so&nbsp;that we&nbsp;could hang it&nbsp;on&nbsp;some hook or&nbsp;holder. And&nbsp;no, there’s no&nbsp;need to&nbsp;untighten and tighten the pack again. Look at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the pack&nbsp;— it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;perforated line. Tear along&nbsp;it, and now you’re good to&nbsp;pull out a&nbsp;cotton pad.</p><p>If&nbsp;you ever tried a&nbsp;Nintendo cartridge to&nbsp;taste you’ll confirm that: they taste <strong>revolting</strong>, leaving a&nbsp;sour-bitterish aftertaste in&nbsp;your mouth. They’re covered with <strong>denatonium benzoate</strong>, one of&nbsp;the most disgusting flavors ever known! Actually, this taste is&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;hidden function&nbsp;— it&nbsp;prevents people from swallowing those cartridges!</p><p>Silica gel can often be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;different things you buy like bags, shoes, and many others. Don’t throw it&nbsp;away<strong>!</strong> It’s meant to&nbsp;absorb excess moisture, so&nbsp;anytime your shoes are a&nbsp;bit wet just throw in&nbsp;a&nbsp;packet with silica gel.</p><p>Escalator brushes aren’t for keeping your shoes clean or&nbsp;polished. It’s for our safety! Brushes won’t let you come close to&nbsp;the edge, so&nbsp;a&nbsp;long coat or&nbsp;bootcut jeans won’t end up&nbsp;in&nbsp;between the steps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fb1/38b/5aafa35687a10c145e88c37d40.png><p>Rough edges on&nbsp;the dimes aren’t just about design. The coins used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;made of&nbsp;precious metals to&nbsp;show their real value. People would shave off the edges, spending the shaven coins with the same value, and melt the edges into new coins. To&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;it, minters added that pattern, so&nbsp;people could tell if&nbsp;somebody cut that coin before.</p><p>Ever noticed a&nbsp;tiny hole in&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;a&nbsp;padlock? Its hidden purpose is&nbsp;to&nbsp;drain water to&nbsp;help avoid corrosion. It’s always the most convenient place to&nbsp;lubricate a&nbsp;padlock: a&nbsp;drop of&nbsp;oil in&nbsp;there will make it&nbsp;open and close easier.</p><p>Bottles have long necks for a&nbsp;reason. Hold the neck, not the bottle if&nbsp;you wanna enjoy a&nbsp;cold drink. The same goes for fancy glasses&nbsp;— their stem saves any drink from overheating, so&nbsp;hold it&nbsp;right!</p><p>Notebook margins are <strong>not some extra space</strong> for note-taking! In&nbsp;fact, people invented them to&nbsp;protect their notes. People used to&nbsp;co-live with rats, and these guys like gnawing on&nbsp;everything they see on&nbsp;their way, including paper! Still, rats weren’t able to&nbsp;chew more than the space left on&nbsp;the margins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/973/c8e/4f77fc5452858a9625fbe5e524.png><p>That black grate on&nbsp;a&nbsp;microwave isn’t just some fancy decoration. It’s called “a&nbsp;Faraday shield” and it&nbsp;prevents the rays from escaping the microwave. It&nbsp;also speeds up&nbsp;the heating, so&nbsp;you could enjoy yesterday’s leftovers faster. It&nbsp;may also block phone signals, so&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re tired of&nbsp;numerous calls just put the phone into a&nbsp;microwave, but don’t turn it&nbsp;on<strong>!</strong></p><p>All Tic Tac containers are designed to&nbsp;dispense one <strong>Tic Tac</strong> every time you open&nbsp;it. The lid has the same shape as&nbsp;the candy. Turn the container upside down, gently shake it&nbsp;and slowly open&nbsp;it, you’ll notice only one candy stuck between those lid grooves. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you just open the container and shake it&nbsp;until five or&nbsp;even more candies fall into your mouth, it&nbsp;means you’ve been eating Tic Tac <strong>wrong</strong> all this time<strong>!</strong></p><p>Those little holes in&nbsp;the airplane windows are designed to&nbsp;control the cabin pressure. They also protect the windows from fogging up&nbsp;as&nbsp;the temperatures drop and rise. By&nbsp;the way, the airplane window is&nbsp;round for a&nbsp;reason&nbsp;— this way, pressure is&nbsp;evenly distributed, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn’t get deformed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/16e/ff4/4d1f8c543e95c0477e14aacf59.png><p>Blue bristles on&nbsp;a&nbsp;toothbrush are actually an&nbsp;indicator that it’s just about time to&nbsp;change the brush. As&nbsp;the bristles get in&nbsp;contact with water, the blue (or&nbsp;whatever other!) pigment fades away, so&nbsp;the more you use&nbsp;it, the duller the color becomes.</p><p>A&nbsp;triple handle on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Jerry can is&nbsp;there to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;easier for<strong> </strong>two people to&nbsp;carry it&nbsp;and distribute the fuel evenly. Gas cans often have a&nbsp;second hole that actually needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;uncapped too before you pour the gas. The air passage will prevent it&nbsp;from pouring out, so&nbsp;no&nbsp;more fuel waste!</p><p>The tab on&nbsp;the rearview mirror does have a&nbsp;function&nbsp;— it&nbsp;holds your air freshener, a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;foam dice, your graduation tassle, and some other useful stuff. But in&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;works as&nbsp;a&nbsp;tumbler between day and night mode. It&nbsp;helps hold the glare from the car behind you&nbsp;— the car lights can blind you!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9xedOhoKefo2LGsMGMn6arn5%2BperW7jKCmqJ%2Bcmnq4tMCtZKKso2KzsL6McWhscGFqfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
