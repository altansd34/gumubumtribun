But FOX just may be pushing the envelope this season with speculation that either Jake Paul or Logan Paul could be under the Grandpa Monster mask.</strong></p><p>But is one of the famous YouTube brothers actually on the show? Let’s investigate the clues and see how they line up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhepQ_8mneA</p>First clues and performance for Grandpa Monster on The Masked Singer…is it Jake Paul or Logan Paul?</figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-grandpa-monster-clues>Grandpa Monster Clues</h4><p>Grandpa Monster’s clues pointed to an athlete with a troubled past. This has lead a lot of predictions that he could be Baker Mayfield, Johnny Manziel, or Jay Cutler. In his clues, Granpa Monster said, “reflecting on my long life, I can’t believe the troublemaking fool I was as a youngster.” We saw a flashback of Grandpa Monster karate chopping a dictionary at school. He was “always acting out to get all eyes” on him. In the classroom, there was a chalkboard with a “6” written on it in what looks like a football play, made of X’s and O’s.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER SEASON 5 GROUP B PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><p>He went on to say that a teacher made him see he was “smarter than the character [he] was playing.” His teacher held up a test with “97%” circled on it. Grandpa Monster then decided to become a star pupil. A shooting star landed on a spider web (can someone say “web star”?). A 6.2 ton kettlebell weight is also shown. Grandpa Monster mentions he’s “still working on shaking [his] bad reputation.” He says “when this old monster takes his mask off, I hope you’re not afraid of who I was a long time ago.”</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-grandpa-monster-performance>Grandpa Monster Performance</h4><p>Singing “Mambo No. 5” by Lou Bega in his first performance, we have to admit that his voice could be Logan Paul’s voice. I mean, compare it with this <a href=#>video of him singing</a>! And the energy and everything matches someone younger too, despite the Grandpa Monster costume. The brothers are definitely goofy enough to pull these antics and dancing!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-grandpa-monster-on-the-masked-singer-jake-paul-or-logan-paul>Is Grandpa Monster on The Masked Singer Jake Paul or Logan Paul?</h2><p>To put it simply, the clues are all pointing this direction. Here’s how everything lines up! First, Cluedle-doo’s clue saying Grandpa Monster “has trained for battle before” could be talking about how Jake/Logan Paul is now a boxer. When Grandpa Monster talks about being a “troublemaking fool as a youngster,” that definitely fits too. Both Jake and Logan have had their fair share of controversy. The two brothers also both played football growing up, which explains the six written like a football play. And that “6” could be referring to 6-second videos on Vine, where the brothers became famous.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>WATCH: <a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER CHAMELEON EXPOSED AS A FAMOUS RAPPER</a></strong></p><p>Jake and Logan have both done acting, so that explains the “acting out clip” and at one point we could hear what sounded like a sound effect from the Nickelodeon show Figure It Out. If that’s true, then that could be pointing to Jake Paul’s show Bizaardvark. The “97%” could be a nod to the year Jake was born. When a shooting star hit a spider web, that’s an obvious reference to them being web stars. The “6.2” on the kettlebell could also be alluding to their heights, or their careers as cruiserweight boxers now.</p><p>Do you agree that Jake Paul or Logan Paul could be the Grandpa Monster on The Masked Singer?
