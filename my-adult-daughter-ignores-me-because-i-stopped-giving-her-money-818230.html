This situation can be&nbsp;deeply distressing for parents who have invested considerable time, effort, and love in&nbsp;nurturing their children to&nbsp;adulthood.</p><p><h2>One parent shared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sincere letter that his daughter had started to&nbsp;ignore him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3be/e15/e79ac35f8391b7d3a670aa7ebf.jpg><p>When faced with demands for financial assistance, some parents may find themselves caught between their desire to&nbsp;help their children and their own financial limitations. However, when unable to&nbsp;meet these demands, it&nbsp;can lead to&nbsp;strained relationships or&nbsp;even complete estrangement.</p><p>Recently one reader shared his story. He’s been supporting his adult daughter through college, but lately, <strong>she’s been ignoring him</strong>, which is&nbsp;really upsetting. He’s always been there for her, but now she won’t even talk to&nbsp;him <strong>unless it’s through email</strong>.</p><p>«I&nbsp;always message my&nbsp;daughter to&nbsp;check on&nbsp;her and see how she’s doing. I&nbsp;call her every day and ask her to&nbsp;give me&nbsp;a&nbsp;call when she wants. I&nbsp;even suggested splitting her bills including plane tickets if&nbsp;she wants to&nbsp;visit&nbsp;me. But all&nbsp;I get back is&nbsp;a&nbsp;quick message saying she’s too busy.»</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;insists on&nbsp;respect.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/154/6ed/8ef1085efb907d4ccbe0324a7f.jpg><p>He’d been there for her every single morning, giving her what she needed to&nbsp;get through the day, bought her a&nbsp;car. But then she went and chose a&nbsp;college far away without even talking to&nbsp;him about it&nbsp;first. It&nbsp;hurt him deep down, made him wonder if&nbsp;she cared about all he’d done. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;reached out in&nbsp;a&nbsp;message, saying he&nbsp;couldn’t keep giving unless she showed some <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a>.</p><p>«I&nbsp;sent her one more message, and still,<strong> no&nbsp;reply</strong>. I&nbsp;might have sounded a&nbsp;bit tough, but I’m just fed up&nbsp;with feeling like I’m not being treated right. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;give&nbsp;up, but&nbsp;I don’t know if&nbsp;it’s the right thing to&nbsp;do.»</p><p><h2>What’s the real reason for cutting off connection.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/32a/384/a6b0d652f29c26d61d24c5ff60.jpg><p>When someone distances themselves from others, sometimes they end up&nbsp;completely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cutting</a> off contact. This can happen after a&nbsp;long time of&nbsp;arguing or&nbsp;if&nbsp;something upsetting happens suddenly. <strong>The person cutting off contact finds it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;deal with the problem directly and calmly</strong>. Instead, they stop talking. They feel like keeping the relationship going is&nbsp;just too hard for them.</p><p>When parents and children are very emotionally involved with each other, they might be&nbsp;more likely to&nbsp;cut off contact when they’re feeling really anxious. Parents feel really powerless when they can’t talk to&nbsp;their child or&nbsp;even work things out with them. They might wonder if&nbsp;they should try to&nbsp;contact their child or&nbsp;not, how long they should keep trying, and what they should say if&nbsp;they do&nbsp;get in&nbsp;touch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/120/6e9/2991525fb18476b6124dddfb33.jpg><p>It’s not an&nbsp;easy situation but here’s what experts advice:</p><li><strong>Find support</strong>. It’s tough when your child stops talking to&nbsp;you, especially when you’re not sure why. That’s why it’s important to&nbsp;have people around who care about you and understand what you’re going through. Talk to&nbsp;friends and family, and think about joining a&nbsp;support group. And if&nbsp;you’re having a&nbsp;hard time coping, it’s okay to&nbsp;seek help from a&nbsp;professional.</li><li><strong>Keep reaching out </strong>even though your child may have stopped talking to&nbsp;you, don’t give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;reaching out to&nbsp;them. Keep letting them know that you love them and want to&nbsp;fix things. Send them messages on&nbsp;special occasions like birthdays and holidays, or&nbsp;just send a&nbsp;quick note to&nbsp;say you’re thinking of&nbsp;them. Show them kindness and love, even as&nbsp;you focus on&nbsp;moving forward with your own life.</li><li>Deal with anger <strong>feeling angry is&nbsp;normal</strong>, but it’s important not to&nbsp;let it&nbsp;take over. Try to&nbsp;understand why this happened without blaming anyone. Instead of&nbsp;getting caught up&nbsp;in&nbsp;anger, take a&nbsp;step back and think about what might have led to&nbsp;the problem. If&nbsp;you can see things from a&nbsp;different perspective, it&nbsp;might make it&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;reconcile if&nbsp;the opportunity arises.</li><li><strong>Listen without defending.</strong> If&nbsp;your child does decide to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;you again, listen to&nbsp;what they have to&nbsp;say without getting defensive. Even if&nbsp;you don’t agree with them, try to&nbsp;see things from their point of&nbsp;view. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;hear criticism, especially if&nbsp;you feel misunderstood, but try to&nbsp;stay open-minded. Remember, your child might be&nbsp;dealing with their own pain, so&nbsp;try to&nbsp;<a href=# title=empathize data-link=tag>empathize</a> with them instead of&nbsp;getting upset.</li><li><strong>Focus on&nbsp;yourself</strong> instead of&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;change your child, focus on&nbsp;improving yourself and your own actions. Let go&nbsp;of&nbsp;any resentment you may have about the situation and try to&nbsp;understand your child’s perspective. By&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;your own growth and forgiveness, you’ll be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;better position to&nbsp;rebuild your relationship if&nbsp;the opportunity arises.</li><p>It’s never easy to&nbsp;maintain wisdom and patience when faced with a&nbsp;<a href=#>child</a> who refuses to&nbsp;communicate. The silence can be&nbsp;deafening, leaving parents feeling helpless and uncertain about how to&nbsp;bridge the gap. In&nbsp;such moments, the urge to&nbsp;push for conversation or&nbsp;resort to&nbsp;frustration may be&nbsp;strong, but it’s essential to&nbsp;remember that understanding and empathy are key.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecCdrKWsXZmutrPHrZyrZZmcu7C%2BxKxkpp1dl7KkrdSsnGahXajBsLzPnptmn5mrtq%2BzjKGcq2WdpLumxYxxaHFqY2V8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
