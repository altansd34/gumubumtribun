He was the villain you loved to hate. Maybe it was an act and maybe it wasn’t. What is definitely true is that modern day Simon Cowell is an old softy. When tragedy struck <a href=#>The X Factor UK</a> singer Scarlett Lee, Simon was there to help.</strong></p><p>Scarlett’s family home burned to the ground last week. She lives there with her brother and his family. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt, although Scarlett did injure her eyes. But, like a true pro, she was on the show this past weekend. Her family lost everything in the fire. Her brother’s kids lost all their toys and the family their clothes, etc. So, Simon had his people go and fill several hampers full of clothes, toys, and other necessities. Scarlett is on his team, however I can see Simon doing this regardless. <a href=#>Scarlett said on Facebook</a>,</p><p>“Where do I even begin? For every person who ask’s what’s Its like to work with simon what’s it like to know him … well Simon not only my mentor but the kindest person I will ever meet, he has a heart of pure gold! tonight we had a surprise delivery for my brother his wife and children full of presents toys for them all, He Has made my family so happy and that means the world to me… You are genuinely the nicest person I’ve ever met and you never forget who was there for you when you’re down and you have stood by us through it all … thank you so so much ???”</p><p>Wow. The “nicest person she ever met”. Who would have thought the old dragon would be called “nice”. <a href=#>Simon also saved several hundred dogs</a> from a Korean meat plant earlier this summer. He’s also helped out many other contestants on the shows in the past. Good on you, Simon.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/simon-cowell-and-louis-walsh.jpg alt="Louis Walsh Said There’s No Hard Feelings Between Him And Simon Cowell" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKGdnKXAbsSMn5icrJ%2Bnera3jJ%2BYr6einsGmedKcmKuklanBbrjEnmSanqSav26yyKucaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
