Despite their polished appearances and dazzling outfits, these stars are not immune to&nbsp;the occasional mishaps or&nbsp;awkward incidents that make them relatable.</p><p><h2>1. John Travolta’s kiss</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8df/405/81472152c3923c9144bdd8f08a.jpg><p><a href=# title="John Travolta" data-link=tag>John Travolta</a> surprised the actress, <a href=# title="Scarlett Johansson" data-link=tag>Scarlett Johansson</a>, by&nbsp;coming up&nbsp;behind her and giving her a&nbsp;kiss on&nbsp;the cheek while she was getting her picture taken at&nbsp;the 87th Academy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Awards</a> in&nbsp;<a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a>. The pictures of&nbsp;this kiss went viral and people started to&nbsp;say that it&nbsp;was awkward.</p><p>Johansson said that there was nothing weird or&nbsp;inappropriate about Travolta. She explained that the picture everyone was talking about was just a&nbsp;moment caught in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>photo</a>, and the actual encounter was sweet and welcome. She also mentioned that <strong>the photo didn’t show what happened before</strong> and after the moment. She pointed out how news can sometimes be&nbsp;misleading and sensationalized by&nbsp;the 24-hour news cycle. Johansson also mentioned that she hadn’t seen Travolta in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while, and it’s always nice to&nbsp;be&nbsp;greeted by&nbsp;him.</p><p><h2>2. Rihanna’s dress</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a15/283/75ec315437946d0353811706b1.jpg><p>Gilbert Flores/Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>During the Met Gala in&nbsp;2014, <a href=# title=Rihanna data-link=tag>Rihanna</a> found herself in&nbsp;an&nbsp;awkward situation with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a>, designed by&nbsp;Stella McCartney. The gown was so&nbsp;long that her friend <a href=# title="Cara Delevingne" data-link=tag>Cara Delevingne</a> was hesitant to&nbsp;step on&nbsp;it, fearing a&nbsp;wardrobe mishap. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;humorous turn of&nbsp;events, McCartney accidentally stepped on&nbsp;the lengthy train, highlighting the challenges that can come with creating extravagant and elaborate fashion statements for such high-profile events.</p><p>The incident added a&nbsp;touch of&nbsp;spontaneity to&nbsp;the glamorous evening, showing that even the most carefully planned outfits can lead to&nbsp;unexpected and amusing moments.</p><p><h2>3. Oscar Isaac and the viral arm-smelling</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b6/5b5/3152f659cf83acd8db5761bb29.jpg><p>2&nbsp;years ago, Oscar Isaac and <a href=# title="Jessica Chastain" data-link=tag>Jessica Chastain</a> created a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>buzz</a> with their red carpet moment while promoting their HBO series, <i>Scenes From a&nbsp;Marriage</i>. They were seen holding hands and being close during photoshoots. Issac even<strong> kissed and sniffed the inside of&nbsp;Chastain’s upper arm at&nbsp;one point</strong>.</p><p>When asked about this, Isaac explained that he&nbsp;and the actress talked to&nbsp;each other like <strong>flatworms</strong>. It&nbsp;might sound strange, but that’s just their way of&nbsp;communicating as&nbsp;good friends.</p><p><h2>4. Kim Kardashian and a&nbsp;flour bomb</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2012, <a href=# title="Kim Kardashian" data-link=tag>Kim Kardashian</a> faced a&nbsp;humiliating incident during her own perfume launch on&nbsp;the red carpet. An&nbsp;unidentified <strong>woman threw flour at&nbsp;her during the launch event </strong>for True Reflection at&nbsp;The London Hotel in&nbsp;West Hollywood.</p><p>Despite arriving in&nbsp;a&nbsp;stylish outfit that included a&nbsp;black blazer, leather trousers, and a&nbsp;bright blue blouse, Kardashian ended up&nbsp;covered in&nbsp;cooking flour within minutes. The substance covered her entire back and shiny hair, transforming her glamorous look into something resembling a&nbsp;mishap in&nbsp;the kitchen. A&nbsp;source later confirmed that the substance was, indeed, cooking <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>flour</a>.</p><p><h2>5. Kristen Stewart’s protest</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c39/bde/8f6a9b571eaa5e05d7c55f98d3.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>One of&nbsp;the standout barefoot moments occurred when <a href=# title="Kristen Stewart" data-link=tag>Kristen Stewart</a> attended the Cannes Film Festival in&nbsp;2018&nbsp;as a&nbsp;jury member for the <i>BlacKkKlansman</i> premiere. Despite wearing a&nbsp;stunning shiny silver Chanel minidress adorned with spiky triangular sequins, Stewart decided to&nbsp;ditch her Louboutin heels. Notably, she removed her black silk shoes, even braving the drizzling rain, to&nbsp;gracefully walk up&nbsp;the red carpet.</p><p>This act garnered praise from fans and the media worldwide. Stewart’s bold move <strong>was a&nbsp;deliberate </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>protest</strong></a><strong> against the festival’s rules</strong>, which required women attending gala premieres to&nbsp;wear heels and strictly prohibited flats.</p><p><h2>6. Behati Prinsloo’s wardrobe malfunction</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/016/b57/9c26d35c9ba5e2041c9ce15ed6.jpg><p>Frederick Taylor/Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>In&nbsp;2015, Behati Prinsloo narrowly avoided a&nbsp;major red carpet <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mishap</a>&nbsp;— a&nbsp;potential wardrobe malfunction. The incident occurred at&nbsp;the <i>Vanity Fair</i> post-Oscars party when she and her husband, Adam Levine, were in&nbsp;attendance.</p><p>Behati was dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;nude-colored outfit for the glamorous event <strong>when her top threatened to&nbsp;reveal more than intended</strong>.

Kate Beckinsale’s bodysuit</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a7/60c/111bb850d392bf9e2d58b4c13a.jpg><p>Kate Beckinsale bought a&nbsp;bodysuit at&nbsp;the airport, and on&nbsp;the way to&nbsp;a&nbsp;premiere with Denzel and Pauletta Washington, the snaps over the crotch popped open, and <strong>it&nbsp;flipped up&nbsp;like a&nbsp;roller blind</strong>. She didn’t want to&nbsp;fix it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the car, so&nbsp;she quietly panicked.</p><p>When she walked onto the red carpet, she told Keanu Reeves and Robert Sean Leonard about the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mishap</a>. In&nbsp;the picture, she’s holding the front part down, and they are holding the back part. They didn’t fully understand what was happening, but they jumped in&nbsp;to&nbsp;help without asking questions. They are absolute legends!</p><p><h2>8. Hayden Panettiere and her long dress</h2></p><p>Hayden Panettiere <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>looked</a> really beautiful at&nbsp;the 2014 Met Gala. The dress she wore, designed by&nbsp;Dennis Blasso, caught a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;eyes. It&nbsp;was elegant on&nbsp;the <i>Nashville</i> star, but it&nbsp;caused a&nbsp;little trouble because it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bit long.</p><p>As&nbsp;she left the event, the actress had a<strong>&nbsp;small stumble while walking down the stairs</strong>. Luckily, she has a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;humor.</p><p><h2>9. Julia Roberts’ fashion protest</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e82/66b/192b105587aaf33577fdc03541.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>In&nbsp;2016&nbsp;at the Cannes Film Festival, Julia Roberts decided to&nbsp;have some<strong> fun with fancy fashion rules</strong>. She wore a&nbsp;simple black gown to&nbsp;the premiere of&nbsp;her movie, <i>Money Monster</i>. The top part of&nbsp;her dress reminded people of&nbsp;the famous red dress she wore in&nbsp;<i>Pretty Woman</i>.</p><p>But when she lifted up&nbsp;the skirt of&nbsp;her Armani Privé gown, guess what? She was barefoot! Yes, that’s right&nbsp;— Julia Roberts walked the red carpet at&nbsp;Cannes without any shoes. This was a&nbsp;big form of&nbsp;rebellion against the fashion <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rules</a>, especially since the festival had reportedly turned away some women the year before for not wearing high heels to&nbsp;a&nbsp;screening of&nbsp;<i>Carol</i>.</p><p><h2>10.
