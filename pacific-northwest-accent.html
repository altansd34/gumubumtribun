Famous for its beautiful coastline, forests, mountains and… accent? Hmmm.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people think that there is no Pacific Northwest accent, but people from the PNW definitely sound different from the US’s east coast. The Pacific Northwest accent has a lot in common with California and a little bit in common with Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>While it might not be the most obvious accent in the United States, let’s talk about how people sound in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Is-there-a-Pacific-Northwest-accent>Is there a Pacific Northwest accent?</h2><p>Many locals will say there isn’t really a Pacific Northwest accent. Oregonians may not think they have an Oregonian accent. The same goes for Seattleites (someone from Seattle) with a Washington accent. But to outsiders, there is an obvious difference between someone from the east, middle, south or west in the United States. The difference between a Pacific Northwest accent and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">California accent</a>, on the other hand, is subtle.</p><p>The Pacific Northwest of the United States includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, parts of Montana and sometimes southern Alaska.</p><p>This and other western parts of the United States didn’t have early British colonies like on the east coast. The PNW didn’t have an aristocracy that copied <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British culture and accents</a>. People migrated to the Pacific Northwest from other parts of the United States and other countries beginning in the early 19th century.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Chinook Jargon</h3><p>The Pacific Northwest has many indigenous cultures as well. There are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">49 federally recognized indigenous tribes</a> in the area. To communicate with European traders, a pidgin language developed in the Pacific Northwest in the 19th century called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinook Jargon</a>. It is still used today and influences place names in the area.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-does-Pacific-Northwest-English-sound-like>What does Pacific Northwest English sound like?</h2><p>So, is Pacific Northwest English that different? Does a Seattle accent sound different from a Portland accent? Maybe. Research about accents in the area is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing to know about how the PNW accent sounds is that it is rhotic (pronouncing all the r’s) and has fewer vowels than the east coast of the USA.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cot-caught merger</h3><p>Secondly, speakers in the Pacific Northwest pronounce the vowels in “cot” and “caught” exactly the same. This is known as the “cot-caught merger” or the “low back vowel merger” that we see in the California accent as well. It can be heard in words like:</p><ul><li>Don – dawn</li><li>Bot – bought</li><li>Pond – pawned</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mary-marry-merry merger</h3><p>Third, the Pacific Northwest accent demonstrates simplified, fewer vowels like with the “mary-marry-merry merger.” Someone from the PNW likely pronounces these vowels exactly the same.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Similarity to the Canadian accent</h3><p>Fourth, two things make this accent similar to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian accent</a>: Bag-beg merger and saying [oʊ] and [eɪ] as monophthongs. Pacific Northwesterners may pronounce the vowel in “bag” and “beg” exactly the same. This also occurs in the word “egg” /ahg/.&nbsp;</p><p>The PNW accent also pronounces the [oʊ] in “boat” and [eɪ] in “bait” similar to Canadians.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>No Canadian Rising</h3><p>Finally, you can hear that with Pacific Northwesterners, the /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ do not rise in tone. Most Canadians have a subtle rising pronunciation such as “price” /pry ees/. Someone from the PNW will not use a rising <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">diphthong</a>. They pronounce this more like a Californian than a Canadian.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Who-has-a-PNW-accent>Who has a PNW accent?</h2><p>A famous example of how people speak in Oregon is the show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Portlandia</a>. Listen to the characters and see if you can detect the accent. Bill Gates is another famous Pacific Northwesterner from Seattle, Washington.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-do-a-Pacific-Northwest-accent>How to do a Pacific Northwest accent</h2><p>Using the tips above, try out some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slang</a> unique to the Pacific Northwest. Here are a few examples.</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=12.5><tr><td><strong>Slang</strong></td><td><strong>Meaning</strong></td><td><strong>Example</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>The mountain is out</td><td>In Seattle, it means the weather is good/clear and you can see Mount Rainier.</td><td>Is the mountain out?

The PNW has a fairly neutral American accent similar to other regions of the western United States. There is some colorful slang too. The next time you’re late in the PNW just tell them the bridge was up.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
