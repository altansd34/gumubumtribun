If you’re still confused, don’t worry. Even native speakers confuse these two little <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">homophones</a> (to be clear, “two” is also pronounced the same, but not many people confuse it with the other to two words.) So, we’re going to teach you what is the difference between “too” and “to” with examples in context. Let’s take a deeper look!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Pronunciation-of-too-vs-to>Pronunciation of too vs to</h2><p>At least the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pronunciation</a> is the same, right? Not so fast. We just said these words are homophones, and that is true up to a point. There is only one way to pronounce the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adverb</a> “too”:&nbsp; /tuː/, with a long oo sound. There are several ways to pronounce the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">preposition</a> “to”: one is /tuː/, with the long oo sound just the same as “too”, but at other times it is pronounced /tə/, which rhymes with “uh”. More on this later.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-different-uses-of-too>The different uses of too</h2><p>“Too” has fewer uses than “to”, so we’ll start here. There are two main uses of “too”:&nbsp;</p><li>To say that something is more than necessary or to a higher degree.&nbsp;</li><ul><li>English grammar is far <strong>too</strong> complicated!&nbsp;</li><li>You can never have <strong>too</strong> much money.&nbsp;</li><li>There are <strong>too </strong>many people in here!&nbsp;</li></ul><li>To mean “as well”, “also”, or “in addition”. It’s often used at the end of a clause with this meaning.&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Are you all going to the movies? Can I come <strong>too</strong>?</li><li>We recently adopted a dog, and then we decided we might as well adopt a cat <strong>too</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If “too” appears in the middle of a sentence, it should have a comma both before and after it.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I, too, am disappointed that we’re not going.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We use a comma before “too” when it comes at the end of a sentence if there is an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“abrupt change of thought”</a>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I always cry at funerals, but I often laugh out of awkwardness, too.</li></ul><p>You will also see “too” in many other phrases. One of the most common ones is “you too”, as a response to someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>“Have a great night!”</p><p>“<strong>You</strong> <strong>too</strong>.”</p><p>Native speakers use “too” for emphasis in place of “very”, for example, “You are too crazy!” Lastly, you’ll see “too” in the abbreviation <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMI</a>, which is short for “too much information”.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-many-uses-of-to>The many uses of to</h2><p>There are far too(!) many uses of the preposition “to” for us to mention all of them here, but we’ll cover some of the most common ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><li>To indicate direction, placement, or motion</li><ul><li>We’re going <strong>to</strong> Spain.&nbsp;</li><li>The bathroom is <strong>to </strong>the left.&nbsp;</li><li>Walk <strong>to</strong> the end of the road.&nbsp;</li></ul><li>To indicate the limit of a range or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">time</a> period</li><ul><li>I like a lot of different cuisines, from Mexican <strong>to </strong>Indian.</li><li>You need to reheat the dish for 3 <strong>to </strong>4 minutes.&nbsp;</li></ul><li>To indicate an object or a recipient</li><ul><li>Give the money <strong>to </strong>me and walk away.&nbsp;</li><li>I sent the email <strong>to</strong> the whole department.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Now back to pronunciation. “To” is<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> often pronounced /tə/</a> with the schwa sound in connected speech. We call this the weak form. Instead of pronouncing it with the long vowel (oo), we pronounce it with a short sound (uh) when we are not emphasizing it – this is most of the time.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-remember-the-difference-between-too-and-to>How to remember the difference between too and to</h2><p>You’ve seen lots of examples of the differences between “too” and “to”, but how can you apply all of this to your own writing? By making substitutions to check. When you write a sentence, try to replace the word “too” or “to” with the words “very”, “also”, or “overly”. If you can do this, you should write “too”. If you can’t, it’s “to”. Here are a few examples:&nbsp;</p><p>It’s <strong>too [overly] </strong>windy to go for a walk right now. 🗹</p><p>That jacket belongs <strong>to [very/also] </strong>me! 🗵</p><p>Ellen’s driving <strong>to [very/also]</strong> Germany today. 🗵</p><p>I’m going to make some extra, so we’ll have dinner for tomorrow <strong>too [also]</strong>. 🗹</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is this too difficult to remember?</h2><p>Of course not! Remember that the adverb “too” means more than needed and as well, while the preposition “to” means… well, everything else we said! It can express directions and the limits of ranges, and indicate objects and recipients of an action. Use the replacement technique to check your own writing and to make sure these tricky little homonyms don’t trip you up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
