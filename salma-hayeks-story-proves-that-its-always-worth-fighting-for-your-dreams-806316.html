Or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least, that’s what has made <a href=# title="Salma Hayek" data-link=tag>Salma Hayek</a>, an&nbsp;unknown Latina actress who faced rejection, never stop believing in&nbsp;herself to&nbsp;achieve everything she once dreamed&nbsp;of.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;believe it’s important to&nbsp;share inspiring stories, and that’s why today we’re going to&nbsp;tell you about Salma Hayek, an&nbsp;example that proves you should always believe in&nbsp;yourself, regardless of&nbsp;what other people say.</p><p><h2>The beginning of&nbsp;her dreams.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/272/a06/3b72205e22a2c5e6424b995bd7.jpg><p>The beginnings of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Salma Hayek</a>’s <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> sprang from her native country, Mexico. The actress was at&nbsp;the peak of&nbsp;her career after having starred in&nbsp;the telenovela <i>Teresa</i>, and in&nbsp;<i>El callejón de&nbsp;los milagros</i>. The latter earned her an&nbsp;Ariel Award nomination, a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;Mexican BAFTA. But she wanted more. She thought of&nbsp;taking things a&nbsp;step further, even if&nbsp;that meant risking it&nbsp;all. And that’s how she made her way into <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca5/530/14af1c531cbd853f36878c57ed.jpg><p>Hayek started by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moving</a> to&nbsp;Los Angeles, California, to&nbsp;study acting. After making a&nbsp;few small appearances, she landed her first starring role. Along with Antonio Banderas, she starred in&nbsp;the film <i>Desperado</i>, which was the first in&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;opportunities to&nbsp;work alongside other well-known celebrities such as&nbsp;<a href=# title="George Clooney" data-link=tag>George Clooney</a>, <a href=# title="Will Smith" data-link=tag>Will Smith</a>, and Penélope Cruz.</p><p><h2>“We&nbsp;are unstoppable girls.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/f3d/71b/06b4f75701af67fbdd55ba6f3e.jpeg><p>Back in&nbsp;the day, it&nbsp;wasn’t easy for Latina actresses to&nbsp;find their place in&nbsp;big productions. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with actress <a href=# title="Drew Barrymore" data-link=tag>Drew Barrymore</a>, she shared that during her career she received negative comments about her low chances of&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;starring role.</p><p>Once, an&nbsp;executive stated that she could not be&nbsp;a&nbsp;star because of&nbsp;her Mexican origins, regardless of&nbsp;acknowledging her great talent: “No&nbsp;matter how beautiful someone thinks you are, no&nbsp;matter how good an&nbsp;actress you are, when you open your mouth, the public will only remember their maids.” But these comments did not stop her. With Drew by&nbsp;her side, she said, “We&nbsp;are part of&nbsp;the generation of&nbsp;actresses who also became entrepreneurs and producers, we&nbsp;are unstoppable girls.”</p><p><h2>“Women can do&nbsp;absolutely anything.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/6aa/cc4/c41ca4550ca633653c16558ae4.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;1999, she founded <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ventanarosa</a>, a&nbsp;production company that has worked on&nbsp;films and television series along with other major companies. In&nbsp;2002, Salma produced and acted in&nbsp;the film <i>Frida</i>, for which she received two Oscars and a&nbsp;nomination for Best Actress.</p><p>At&nbsp;the launch of&nbsp;the series <i>Monarca</i>, which she produced, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talked</a> about how she used to&nbsp;think about herself when she was younger: “When I&nbsp;look at&nbsp;pictures of&nbsp;me&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;30s or&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;40s, I&nbsp;see myself more beautiful than&nbsp;I saw myself at&nbsp;the time. I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;criticize myself so&nbsp;much.”</p><p><h2>“Breastfeeding is&nbsp;a&nbsp;shared experience.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16a/d91/03d8fa528eafc23ddb5afa7364.jpg><p>Salma is&nbsp;an&nbsp;advocate of&nbsp;breastfeeding and has promoted its benefits for babies. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>trip</a> to&nbsp;Sierra Leone, taking advantage of&nbsp;her motherhood, she breastfed an&nbsp;African baby: “I&nbsp;was weaning Valentina, but&nbsp;I still had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;milk that&nbsp;I was pumping, so&nbsp;I breastfed the baby. You should have seen his eyes. When he&nbsp;felt the nourishment, he&nbsp;immediately stopped crying.”</p><p>She has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posted</a> pictures on&nbsp;social media with captions promoting the importance of&nbsp;breastfeeding, all this despite her busy schedule: “When I&nbsp;was shooting <i>30&nbsp;Rock</i>, I&nbsp;was still breastfeeding Valentina. I&nbsp;did it&nbsp;until she was 14&nbsp;months old. The benefits of&nbsp;breastfeeding are immeasurable for babies!”</p><p><h2>“A&nbsp;good leader”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a5/bd9/14522c53a6b88552d5e9b1ffb0.jpg><p>“Having her support and what she believes in&nbsp;and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother and to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;love, to&nbsp;make mistakes, or&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;vulnerable. These things are incredibly brave things and qualities a&nbsp;leader must have; a&nbsp;good leader.” Those were the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>words</a> of&nbsp;the director Chloé Zhao when she cast Salma as&nbsp;the new superheroine of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Marvel data-link=tag>Marvel</a> world. Hayek announced she is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the starring role as&nbsp;Ajak in&nbsp;<i>Eternals</i>, where she plays the leader of&nbsp;the superheroes who will save humanity.</p><p>This role represented a&nbsp;great achievement for the actress, who emphasized that a&nbsp;door had been opened for all Latinos who have been waiting for such a&nbsp;moment. In&nbsp;tears, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> the emotion she felt when she put on&nbsp;her costume: “I&nbsp;saw my&nbsp;brown face in&nbsp;a&nbsp;superhero suit; I&nbsp;saw my&nbsp;face as&nbsp;a&nbsp;little girl, who had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;courage to&nbsp;dream big. I&nbsp;saw the face of&nbsp;all little girls.”</p><p><h2>“Work hard. Prepare.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc7/e6e/5761ef594abc9983f10d01cee2.jpg><p>After forging a&nbsp;great career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, producer, activist, and entrepreneur, in&nbsp;November 2021, Salma unveiled her star on&nbsp;the Hollywood Walk of&nbsp;Fame. During her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>speech</a>, she recalled that she was repeatedly rejected for leading roles: “Why don’t you go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;telenovelas? You’ll never find work here.” Salma kept repeating to&nbsp;herself: “Nobody wants me&nbsp;here. They want me&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;country.”</p><p>Despite the disappointment and sadness, she did not give&nbsp;up. She chose to&nbsp;fight for her dreams and said, “Work hard. Prepare. Don’t care what anybody says. But most importantly, don’t listen to&nbsp;yourself when you bring yourself down.”</p><p>What has been the biggest dream you’ve fulfilled?
