The actress, best known for her work in&nbsp;shows like <i>The Last of&nbsp;Us</i> and <i>Castle Rock</i>, is&nbsp;breaking free from the mold and proving that she’s more than just her body type.</p><p><h2>Melanie Lynskey struggled for recognition in&nbsp;Hollywood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b03/4e2/ed629a56a285a09fda8dce2c3d.jpg><p>For a&nbsp;decade, Melanie Lynskey struggled to&nbsp;break out of&nbsp;the supporting roles <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> pigeonholed her into. Despite her talent, casting agents and her own representation only saw her as&nbsp;the sister, the friend, and the occasional eccentric character. Even her role as&nbsp;Charlie Sheen’s erotomaniac neighbor in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Two and a&nbsp;Half Men</i></a> failed to&nbsp;garner her the recognition she deserved.</p><p><h2>She was body-shamed and typecast.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3dd/4ef/684c505bc5ad02bb295a4a3962.jpg><p>Evan Agostini / Invision / East News</p><p>The actress, despite being slender, was still not deemed thin enough for the entertainment industry. Instead of&nbsp;giving her roles that showcased her talent, she was often relegated to&nbsp;superficial and trivial characters that solely focused on&nbsp;her body type.</p><p>One particular example was a&nbsp;script that required her character to&nbsp;snack in&nbsp;every scene. Melanie Lynskey, recalling the experience, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “There was one thing&nbsp;I read where the person had a&nbsp;candy bar in&nbsp;every scene.”</p><p><h2>The type of&nbsp;roles she was offered were limiting.</h2></p><p>Despite the romance and excitement in&nbsp;her personal life, she was continually cast in&nbsp;dull roles that failed to&nbsp;showcase her range as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress.</p><p>“In&nbsp;my&nbsp;own life, I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;romantic drama. It&nbsp;was impossible for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;stay single,” she said. “It&nbsp;was kind of&nbsp;a&nbsp;strange disconnect. I&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;I was pretending when&nbsp;I was going in&nbsp;and auditioning to&nbsp;play these dowdy people,” she added.<br></p><p><h2>She longs to&nbsp;portray engaging characters who aren’t defined by&nbsp;their physical appearance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/54b/d94/17d71b532fb3044e3168c0647f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;portray an&nbsp;intriguing character who isn’t concerned with her physical appearance, she expressed, “I&nbsp;very much want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;screen representing an&nbsp;interesting person who’s not paying attention to&nbsp;what her tummy looks like.”</p><p>“If&nbsp;there were more people who look like&nbsp;me, then&nbsp;I wouldn’t have to&nbsp;talk about it&nbsp;as&nbsp;much,” she added.</p><p><h2>Recently, her husband stood up&nbsp;for her against the body-shaming trolls.<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ef/a3d/0592b156d2b9ea662741398ac7.jpg><p>Melanie’s husband, Jason Ritter, also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>voiced</a> his support for her by&nbsp;sharing a&nbsp;clever message on&nbsp;his social media, “If&nbsp;anyone has any further unsolicited comments about <i>anybody</i> else’s body, they can feel free to&nbsp;write them in&nbsp;permanent ink onto their own foreheads and swan dive directly into the sun.”</p><p>Explore additional articles featuring body-positive celebrities who have spoken out against Hollywood’s unrealistic <a href=# title="beauty standards" data-link=tag>beauty standards</a>:</p><p>Preview photo credit Evan Agostini / Invision / East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqmuMCnoJ5lnK67tLfEsmSiq12ZvK%2BxjLCgraBdl7KqusZmq7KolZiutMCMm5isnZRivK95x56pZpqfmcZuhJBra25rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
