After various weeks of guessing, the show’s newest coaches seemingly confirmed their involvement in a series of cryptic Instagram posts. If these posts are true, Kelly Clarkson will return to The Voice alongside Chance The Rapper, Niall Horan, and Blake Shelton.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kelly Clarkson, Blake Shelton, Niall Horan, Chance The Rapper to Coach The Voice Season 23??</h2><p>Ahead of this series of posts, many fans had guessed Clarkson would return, since her talk show isn’t filming during the upcoming dates. As for Chance The Rapper and Niall Horan… I don’t think anyone expected those. If this confirmation is new, it could bring a whole new spin to the series.</p><p>For those who don’t know <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Chance the Rapper</a> rose to fame in 2013 with the release of his second mixtape, Acid Rap. He has quickly become a popular mainstream artist and has won three Grammy Awards in his career. Niall Horan on the other hand, everyone surely knows. Horan rose to fame as part of the series The X Factor UK. After a successful audition, he was paired with Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson to create a group called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Direction</a>. Since the group split in 2015, Horan has gone on to have a successful solo career.</p><p>We’re currently awaiting a formal confirmation for the newest The Voice coaches, but it seems like this might be it. Fans are over the moon to hear that Clarkson will be returning to the show after a gap year. Clarkson was first seen on&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;as Shelton’s mentor in season two of the series, she later returned as the mega mentor in season 13.</p><p>This singer joined the series as a coach in season 14 (2018) and gained her first win with&nbsp;<a href=#>Brynn Cartelli</a>. Following that season, Clarkson went on to win season 15 with Chevel Shepherd, 17 with Jake Hoot, and 21 with Girl Named Tom. The singer has yet to comment on her departure from the series.</p><p>Blake Shelton on the other hand will be reclaiming his title as the king of The Voice once again. He is the longest running coach on the series to date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-to-attend-tapings>How to Attend Tapings</h2><p>It’s been previously reported that The Voice season 23 is set to film blind auditions on October 13, 14, 15, and 16. It’s no surprise that nearly days before the auditions start the show would cryptically confirm the new judges.</p><p>Fans that are interested in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">attending</a> should be fully vaccinated and wear face coverings at all times unless told otherwise. Filming takes place in Universal City, California, with two tapings each day at 9 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. PT.</p><p>The Voice&nbsp;began holding virtual auditions in June of this year. Fine print&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">about auditioning</a>&nbsp;made it clear that potential contestants should be available between October 2022 and May 2023. This would seem to fit the typical production timeline of a spring season.</p><p>We’re unsure at this time if The Voice will return to it’s two-season format, but this confirmation could definitely be confirming one. Regardless if this confirmation is legit or not, we’re excited to see the next season of The Voice and even more excited to see the Battle Rounds on The Voice season 22.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Voice-Morgan-Myles-Steven-McMorran.png alt="‘The Voice’ Recap: Battles Continue with Powerhouse Matchups" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlk52ur6%2FEZquhnV2nrrG8xKtkp6GRoblutM6rmKdlkqGurLGMrJ%2BepKSku27AzmaaqJmTnXq1tMRmraihk5p6tLHArKanZWJofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
