<span class=val><a href=./categories/celeb>Celeb</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>Can You Make Someone Fall in Love With You? Science Says Yes</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most important questions when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;romantic relationships. A&nbsp;great number of&nbsp;studies that have been conducted prove that we&nbsp;really can control <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. Because in&nbsp;general, this is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;basic <a href=#>psychological emotion</a> like fear, joy, pity, and other emotions that can be&nbsp;regulated if&nbsp;they are monitored well. So, how do&nbsp;we&nbsp;use <a href=# title=psychology data-link=tag>psychology</a> and psychological tricks to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;make others fall in&nbsp;love with&nbsp;us?</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> has found out that, in&nbsp;fact, love is&nbsp;not about “fate.” This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;collaboration of&nbsp;biological, chemical, and psychological mechanisms. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;find the right approach to&nbsp;these and use them for your own purposes.</p><p>The most important thing you need to&nbsp;understand is&nbsp;that the other person must at&nbsp;least have minimal feelings for you. Then, you will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;turn these into real, deep feelings, easily and quickly.</p><p><h2>1. Don’t get ice cream on&nbsp;the first date.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a45/e89/8582ba56c68dafeac2fc985fa9.jpg><p>Social psychologist John Bargh who works at&nbsp;Yale University studies the role of&nbsp;unconscious processing on&nbsp;social behavior. Some of&nbsp;his <a href=#>studies</a> found an&nbsp;interesting connection between the body temperature of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person and their psychological state.</p><p>It&nbsp;turned out that when we&nbsp;are <a href=#>physically warm</a>, we&nbsp;are more likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nice and friendly to&nbsp;other people. This trick may really come in&nbsp;handy, for example, during a&nbsp;first date when it’s especially important to&nbsp;gain the person’s trust. So&nbsp;remember this and make sure that in&nbsp;the future you choose only warm places, foods, and drinks so&nbsp;that every meeting you have (both romantic and business-related) goes well.</p><p><h2>2. The advantages of&nbsp;extended eye contact</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/962/be7/47dac4563c8863891582a30b92.jpg><p>Harvard psychologist Zick Rubin conducted a&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;understand if&nbsp;it’s possible to&nbsp;measure love. He&nbsp;found the answer in&nbsp;the eyes, or&nbsp;more specifically, in&nbsp;the frequency and duration that people look at&nbsp;each other. He&nbsp;found that that couples who are deeply in&nbsp;love look at&nbsp;each other&nbsp;75% of&nbsp;the time during a&nbsp;conversation and that they stop looking at&nbsp;each other reluctantly. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal conversation, people look at&nbsp;each other from&nbsp;30% to&nbsp;60% of&nbsp;the time.</p><p>However, looking into someone’s eyes may not only be&nbsp;a&nbsp;consequence of&nbsp;being in&nbsp;love but it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;the <a href=#>reason</a>. When you look at&nbsp;someone for a&nbsp;long time and you do&nbsp;it&nbsp;frequently, you trick the person’s mind because it&nbsp;remembers what the “love look” is. So, it&nbsp;starts thinking romantically about you. The nervous system starts producing phenethylamine which causes the sensations that we&nbsp;have when we&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love: “butterflies in&nbsp;the stomach,” an&nbsp;increased heart rate, warm palms. How could anyone resist?</p><p><h2>3. Tell them something awkward about yourself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b3/8dc/1531fe5f06aa032bbd642f2794.jpg><p>It’s obvious that an&nbsp;open and <a href=# title=communicative data-link=tag>communicative</a> person has more chances to&nbsp;be&nbsp;liked. So&nbsp;there is&nbsp;nothing surprising about the fact that if&nbsp;you fearlessly share facts about yourself and your life, you make other people like you.</p><p><h2>4. Don’t do&nbsp;anything. Just let them do&nbsp;something for you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/471/251/959bce5f0384e0cb0e9a1d1909.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;good thing or&nbsp;help someone, we&nbsp;feel good. We&nbsp;are happy with ourselves and have very warm emotions for the person we&nbsp;helped. When we&nbsp;justify our effort, we&nbsp;idealize the person we&nbsp;were so&nbsp;generous to&nbsp;and convince ourselves that they deserve this treatment. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, we&nbsp;have an&nbsp;emotional anchor and start liking the person even more.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, when someone does something for&nbsp;us, we&nbsp;like it&nbsp;too. But it’s about different emotions and not all of&nbsp;them are very positive. We&nbsp;mostly feel as&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;owe to&nbsp;the person and we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;pay them back. Things are even harder when this is&nbsp;someone we&nbsp;don’t really like. So, we&nbsp;should keep this <a href=#>psychological effect</a> in&nbsp;mind.</p><p><h2>5. Make up&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret language just for the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/741/71f/e2dc4c5f48b857bc9a2a394c0b.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;about inside jokes, special words, and unique gestures that happen between people when they find common ground and become truly close. Maybe you like the same movie, comedy show, song, book, or&nbsp;even meme. And maybe the joke appeared spontaneously during your first date, a&nbsp;walk together, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;meeting. Don’t ignore these little things.</p><p>When you find and use this phrase in&nbsp;your everyday communication, you will take your relationship to&nbsp;whole new level. The relationship will become even stronger and more intimate. The scientists from Texas University came to&nbsp;this conclusion in&nbsp;their <a href=#>study</a>. We&nbsp;all want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;special and unique, and this secret language helps&nbsp;us feel that we&nbsp;understand each other better than anyone else.</p><p><h2>6. The size of&nbsp;the pupils matter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb7/8a0/bb7f4650118cf3bc172a27804a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent study, scientists <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>researched</a> the connection between the size of&nbsp;the pupil and the attractiveness of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person. Participants were shown different faces and asked to&nbsp;judge the roundness of&nbsp;these faces. Not all round faces had big pupils, but the results showed a&nbsp;strong connection between attractiveness and sizeable pupils.</p><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;use this effect to&nbsp;your advantage. Of&nbsp;course, you can’t change the size of&nbsp;your pupil on&nbsp;purpose, but you can make the conditions right, for example, dim the light. Use candles instead of&nbsp;regular lights. Or&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant that is&nbsp;famous for its relaxing atmosphere.</p><p><h2>7. Be&nbsp;near them often... But then, make them miss you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f38/838/5133965f4080deb8a319dce50e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;our dreams, we&nbsp;can all find someone we&nbsp;like, tell them about our feelings, and live together happily ever after. In&nbsp;the real world, things are not that easy, that’s why people need to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with special tactics.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, it’s important to&nbsp;spend more time together when the feeling is&nbsp;mutual. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;know each other better, to&nbsp;break the ice and build a&nbsp;connection, you need to&nbsp;spend some time together. But after several dates, psychologists <a href=#>recommend</a> to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break (even if&nbsp;you don’t want&nbsp;to) to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;deficit of&nbsp;your presence in&nbsp;the other person’s life. This move achieves several things:</p><ul><li>You won’t get tired of&nbsp;each other (over time, feelings stop being so&nbsp;new, and in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;keep them alive, you need to&nbsp;play hard-to-get);</li><li>The person gets the chance to&nbsp;understand how nice and important this relationship has become for them (limited and rare things are always more desired);</li><li>You can take control of&nbsp;your own emotions and think clearly.</li></ul><p><h2>8. Make a&nbsp;positive association</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a27/79b/6e20335121bf87ba52aaf0304e.jpg><p>You can program someone else’s brain by&nbsp;repeating the same thoughts over and over again. This is&nbsp;why it’s so&nbsp;important to&nbsp;carefully choose words when communicating with people who are very important to&nbsp;us.</p><p>You can use this principle to&nbsp;improve your <a href=#>image</a>. The better you present yourself, the more positive thoughts you will leave in&nbsp;a&nbsp;person’s mind even when you are not around. And it&nbsp;doesn’t really matter if&nbsp;you are really so&nbsp;positive (everyone has their flaws). The only thing that matters here is&nbsp;how you are perceived and how you want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;perceived.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think these tips will be&nbsp;useful for you?
