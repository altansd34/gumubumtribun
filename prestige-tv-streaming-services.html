But analysts pointed to “WandaVision,” an exploration of grief and a creative take on the classic sitcom, as Disney’s way of using Marvel characters to tell more mature stories that rival what cable networks have done for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">According to Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore’s senior media analyst, Disney’s strength is its ability to attract established writers and filmmakers to helm these unique TV projects and allow for some creative freedom. (For its major <i>film</i> franchises, Disney has historically <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>clashed with directors</a>, leading many to believe the company wasn’t allowing for much creative independence.)&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“There's a perception of quality surrounding Marvel, and I think that's really paid off big,” Dergarabedian said. “Disney+ has created a perfect platform to do long-form, episodic content, and while Marvel may seem like it's just for the masses, the beauty of it is they can dig deep into these characters and take a lot of risks.”</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Peacock has prestige potential -— if viewers discover its shows&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In its first year, NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming service had 54 million sign-ups and over 20 million monthly active accounts, per the company’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>second-quarter earnings report</a>, though Comcast Corp. Chief Executive Jeff Shell was less forthcoming in the company’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>third-quarter earnings call</a>, simply saying the service is “heading in the right direction” without sharing specific numbers.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Peacock is getting its footing, and I would never count them out,” said Scott Schiller, global chief commercial officer for the media-marketing services company ENGINE and an adjunct assistant professor at NYU's Stern School of Business. “At the same time what they will need, like any fledgling business needs, is a show or shows that drive usage.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Large viewership is not required to be known as a prestige TV destination. Several critically acclaimed and Emmy-winning shows on FX, for instance, never really caught on with viewers. But the network was able to cultivate that brand over several years of releasing well-received shows, such as “The Americans,” “The Shield” and “Justified.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6W%2Fpr%2FTop6eZaSrerTA0Z6YpqGenHq0sdGvoJydow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
