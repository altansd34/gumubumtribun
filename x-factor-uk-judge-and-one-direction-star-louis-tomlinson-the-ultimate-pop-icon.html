The five member English pop group has gone on to sell over 50 million albums world wide and helped launch the solo careers of Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, and Niall Horan. Initially each member was rejected as soloist during Season 7, but was put in a group and mentored by Simon Cowell. Tomlinson returned to his stomping grounds when he became a judge on Season 15 of The X Factor UK.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-one-direction-wasn-t-louis-tomlinson-s-first-band>One Direction Wasn’t Louis Tomlinson’s First Band</h2><p>When he was 14 years old Tomlinson was kicked out of a band and replaced as the lead vocalist. This prompted him to audition for The X Factor. In 2009 Tomlinson auditioned but failed to make it past the producers. He returned the following year for the show’s seventh season. In 2010 the singer received three yeses from judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, and Nicole Scherzinger.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Was Signed to a Two Million Dollar Contract</h2><p>One Direction is the biggest act to come out of any X Factor franchise. When Cowell believes in a contestant he will do what it takes to help make the contestant or contestants stars. After finishing in third place, Tomlinson along with his bandmates were signed to a two million dollar contract. Their success came by way of Cowell’s Syco Records.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Louis Tomlinson’s Own Record Label and Management Company</h2><p>In 2015, Tomlinson created his own record label. Triple Strings Ltd was an imprint of Syco Records. It is not unheard of for artists to start their own imprint in hopes of launching the next big music star. The singer had a lesson in music business when he still found it increasingly difficult to sign artists who the higher ups at Syco Records had no faith in. Instead of giving up, Tomlinson started his own music management company to help develop artists in a different way.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/x9H97hA78UQ</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Louis Tomlinson Leaves Syco Records</h2><p>The singer was the last remaining One Direction member who was still signed to their original label. Five months after Tomlinson released his debut album Walls he parted ways with Syco in a mutual agreement. Tomlinson was with the company for ten years and was able to score the third best selling album in the UK with Walls. In a shocking twist, Cowell walked away from his company months after Tomlinson left. The former <a href=#>American Idol</a> judge said he was stepping away to focus on his TV company.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Signed With BMG</h2><p>Tomlinson signed with BMG almost a year after leaving Syco Records. His new label will be the home for his upcoming sophomore album. The singer is also planning to relaunch his massive world tour. Tomlinson’s first world tour was cut short due to the pandemic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tomlinson Wrote “Two of Us” for His Mother</h2><p>Tragedy struck when the singer’s mother died due to cancer in 2016. Tomlinson was open about how he hit rock bottom after the loss. The songwriter was unable to feel the songs he wrote until he wrote his single “Two of Us.” Two years after his mother’s death Tomlinson’s sister passed away at 18 years old from an accidental drug overdose.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1390953319.jpg alt="Jimmie Allen Opens Up About Mental Health Struggles With New “Untitled Song”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>louis tomlinson</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the x-factor UK</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5712admpukpL9uwcpmoa6cl5p6orrDZqannV2ZtrOxwq2gqKZdqMGivoylpq6ho2LBsLnLoqWsp55iwamxjK6jraGdlsGmec%2Bop2ahk6S7cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
