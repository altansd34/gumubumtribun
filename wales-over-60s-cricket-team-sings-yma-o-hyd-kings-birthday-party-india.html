Year-long celebrations will bring the two countries together through a series of events, stories and activities which celebrate the two cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Over-60s World Cup</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The International Masters Cricket (IMC) Over-60s World Cup takes place every two years, with Wales’ over-60s finishing 5th last time out in Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Members of the Welsh team have already expressed belief that they can do better than last time but will face tough competition from the likes of England, current holders Pakistan, and Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Taking place in Chennai, India, Wales lost their first match against Australia by 168 runs and they’ll be there for around 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Huw said: “Since we arrived in India it has been amazing. Training has been hard – it was 32 degrees during our training session, but there was no breeze. In Wales, we have been practicing in the stormy weather so it will take some time to get used to. The team is so proud to represent Wales in India. It is about representing Wales and our unique nation.&nbsp;</p><p>The 61-year-old added: “We saw the effect the Welsh football team had on the world, and we also see this as a way to put Wales on the map. It is a tremendous opportunity to show our language and heritage on a big stage and it makes us proud to be here. The people in India do live and breathe cricket, it’s an incredible country.”&nbsp;</p><p>Interim CEO at Cricket Wales, Mark Frost, said: “Having toured India several times, it is a country where you need to get to grips with the conditions in many ways compared to being back home in Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This group of players have given a lot to the game and to see them having this experience is very pleasing and a great reward for all of them.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Team&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The squad is made up of 17 Welsh players, including one player, Dan Pigott, who will be taking part in two seniors world cups this year – as he’s due to represent Wales in Hockey too. Dan will be going to New Zealand for the Masters Hockey World Cup in November.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also one player who once held a record for extreme ironing, and another who adopted a helmet, after being shot at during a match.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Martin Powell, 60, from Swansea recalls his experience: “In 2001, I was playing for a club in Sengenydd, where I was shot at.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“I was playing really well, and I looked over toward the fielders on the offside, I was surprised that they were all laying down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The wicketkeeper told me there was a man in a window with an air rifle and because I was one of the taller players, I should get down.&nbsp;</p><p>“As soon as I fell to the ground, I heard the air rifle fire. It was an unusual set of circumstances but luckily, we were safe, and the police arrived a short while later. The game resumed an hour later, and I scored 100 runs, so it turned out to be a great day!”&nbsp;</p><p>He added: “I still came back the following week to play again, but this time, I was inspired to spend £50 on a helmet.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mike Davies, 60, from Swansea has been playing cricket since he was 12, but once held a unique record outside of the sport. For extreme ironing.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “In 2002, I held the world record for Extreme Ironing in the Andes.&nbsp;</p><p>“Me and my friend organised an eight-day trek to get to Machu Picchu, it was his idea to carry an ironing board on his back and I had an iron in my rucksack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We were five days into our trek and reached Salkantay Trek, where we were 5,000 meters above sea level and I said, ‘This is it’. I started ironing, and my friend took pictures, and we sent them out. It was an amazing experience because we were so high up and had set a world record.”&nbsp;</p><p>For the latest news and updates on Wales in India, follow @WalesInIndia on twitter and Wales in India on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmoqaUnq5ww8ClnKxln6uys3mVaapmm6KesKyx02arnpmdYsCqusasZLKlkWK8brTYnWSkoZ6cwG6uyKuroZyRrnqxrdGtsGahnpm2og%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
