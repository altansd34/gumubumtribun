This is yet another thing that symbolizes their intense love for one another. For those who may not know, the Dancing With The Stars pro announced her engagement to the Beverly Hills 90210 alum in September after three years of dating.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sharna-burgess-brian-austin-green-get-matching-tattoos>Sharna Burgess, Brian Austin Green Get Matching Tattoos</h2><p>Over the weekend, Burgess revealed on Instagram that she and Green have decided to get matching tattoos. In the post, the ballroom dancer shared a photo of her and Green’s hands holding each other. At the back of Green’s hand are inked letters “LO” while the letters “VE” are marked on Burgess’s. In another photo, DWTS pro’s clasped hands are shown, displaying the same art as Green’s.</p><p>“For each other and for ourselves,” she wrote.</p><p>In the same post, Burgess revealed that she also got another tattoo to honor her son <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zane Walker</a>. The dancer stated that she’ll be willing to share the art once it’s healed.</p><p>This gesture of love has melted their fans who took their reactions to the comment section. At some point, one fan got confused about the tattoo design.</p><p>“I’m not getting this. The first picture is both of your hands with LO VE. Very nice but the 2nd picture looks like both of your hands,” the person wrote.</p><p>The comment has sparked a conversation in the replies, prompting several fans to explain.</p><p>“When holding hands spells love symbolizes ‘for each other’ and having love on their own hands put together symbolizes ‘for ourselves’. So it’s best of both worlds,” one person explained.</p><p>In September, the couple <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in their iHeartRadio podcast Oldish that they’ve been engaged for two months. Green popped the question during a surprise birthday party that Burgess organized in June. The author enlisted his children in the proposal, giving the dancer a red Cartier box to mark the special moment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-s-on-the-hunt-for-the-perfect-wedding-dress>She’s On the Hunt for the Perfect Wedding Dress</h2><p>Now that Burgess and Green are officially engaged, so now it’s time for their wedding preparations. Recently, the Australian dancer gave an update about their plans, stating that she still hasn’t decided about her dress.</p><p>“I’ve looked at dresses that I love, and I don’t know what to do. I’m so overwhelmed,” she said. “They’re all so amazing. And there are so many designers that I love. There are actually a couple of Australian designers I love as well. I’m hoping to do something really, really beautiful and unique.”</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro, she has been creating Pinterest boards and saving Instagram posts to give herself ideas regarding her wedding gown. With all the confusion going on, Burgess knew that she has to hire a wedding planner.</p><p>“I shall not be doing this on my own. I was in a family wedding this week in Vegas, and the bride was so stressed. That will not be me. But we’re gonna give it time. We’re gonna give it time to know what we want,” she said.</p><p>Amid the preparations, Burgess revealed that the wedding will not be happening anytime yet. As per the dancer, she and Green may be “two years away” from the big day.</p><p>Of their plans of expanding the family, Burgess stated that they still aren’t sure. She opened up about the topic via Instagram Story after a fan asked the question about it.</p><p>“Truthfully … we don’t know,” she wrote. “We have a big tribe and while we talk often about adding one more, there isn’t really a decision made.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_LAReid_DemiLovato_BritneySpears_SimonCowell_Steve-Granitz_WireImage-220x147.jpg alt="Britney Spears Says She ‘Absolutely Hated’ Judging ‘The X Factor’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qGYq6aRYq%2B2vsaeqqxlkqe2orqMmqysrJmjeqi%2BxJ6lZquYpMRuu8WfZKaZpJi1qrrGZqOorpViwaLA06imrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
