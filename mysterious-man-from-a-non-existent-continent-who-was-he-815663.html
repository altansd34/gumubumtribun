Unfortunately, we’re not developed enough yet to&nbsp;prove or&nbsp;disprove&nbsp;it. But it’s still an&nbsp;interesting theory, and that’s why we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;unusual urban legends about “the guests from a&nbsp;parallel reality”, according to&nbsp;many. Let’s check out a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;them. A&nbsp;man from a&nbsp;non-existent country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/66f/872/cca0035cfea0efbbecdc6c7f91.png><p>This story took place in&nbsp;1851 in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small German village, Frankfurt an&nbsp;der Oder. A&nbsp;lost man came out to&nbsp;the local villagers asking for help. The man introduced himself as&nbsp;Jophar Vorin. He&nbsp;spoke very poor German and had a&nbsp;very strong accent. The man himself claimed that he&nbsp;speaks “Laxar” and “Abram”&nbsp;— languages that don’t actually exist on&nbsp;our <a href=# title=Earth data-link=tag>Earth</a>.</p><p>He&nbsp;claimed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;from “Laxaria”&nbsp;— a&nbsp;country on&nbsp;the mainland called “Sakria”, separated from <a href=# title=Europe data-link=tag>Europe</a> by&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge ocean. However, none of&nbsp;these places existed on&nbsp;the Earth’s map. People sent Jophar to&nbsp;the local authorities. He&nbsp;talked to&nbsp;a&nbsp;psychiatrist, but the doctor concluded that the man was totally sane. An&nbsp;investigation by&nbsp;the local police also revealed nothing suspicious about him.</p><p>Jophar Vorin claimed that the purpose of&nbsp;his visit to&nbsp;Europe was to&nbsp;find his long-lost brother. He&nbsp;survived a&nbsp;shipwreck and found himself near the village. They showed him a&nbsp;map of&nbsp;the world and a&nbsp;globe and asked him to&nbsp;indicate the place where he&nbsp;crashed, but he&nbsp;didn’t recognize anything familiar. He&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;have extensive knowledge about his home world.</p><p>Jophar named five main continents on&nbsp;it: Sakria, Aflar, Astar, Auslar, and Euplar. His story was considered plausible. Scientists from Frankfurt decided to&nbsp;send the man to&nbsp;Berlin for further research. However, during the trip, he&nbsp;had something like a&nbsp;seizure. The man suddenly jumped out of&nbsp;the carriage and disappeared into the surrounding forest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/695/a69/7d96e15952ad372fd6c45f4698.png><p>Despite a&nbsp;long and thorough search, no&nbsp;traces of&nbsp;Jophar were found. He&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;have disappeared as&nbsp;mysteriously as&nbsp;he&nbsp;had appeared. Inspector Labeouf, who was assigned to&nbsp;escort him to&nbsp;Berlin, thought that this man could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;“being from another world” and that he&nbsp;returned from where he&nbsp;came from. Lady on&nbsp;Highway 167.</p><p>This incident happened on&nbsp;October&nbsp;20, 1969. It&nbsp;was first reported in&nbsp;1988 in&nbsp;the magazine Strange. The article tells about two men, L.C. and his business partner Charlie (the names are fictitious). One afternoon, L.C. and Charlie were driving along Highway 167 in&nbsp;southwest Louisiana. Discussing work, they drove towards the oil center of&nbsp;Lafayette. The highway was empty at&nbsp;first, but then the men noticed a&nbsp;very old and very slow car ahead.</p><p>The men started discussing this mysterious car. Such cars haven’t been produced for several decades, but this one looked quite new. The men thought it&nbsp;was thanks to&nbsp;the owner’s care and admired&nbsp;it. They slowed down to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;better look at&nbsp;the car. L.C. noticed a&nbsp;bright orange sign on&nbsp;it&nbsp;that said “1940”. They saw a&nbsp;driver. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;young woman in&nbsp;old-fashioned clothes: a&nbsp;hat with a&nbsp;long feather and a&nbsp;fur coat, even though it&nbsp;was warm outside.</p><p>There was a&nbsp;child next to&nbsp;her, also dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;warm coat and a&nbsp;hat. L.C. and Charlie wanted to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;her, but then they noticed the expression on&nbsp;her face. The woman was looking around in&nbsp;panic, almost on&nbsp;the verge of&nbsp;crying. L.C. called out to&nbsp;her and asked if&nbsp;she needed help. She nodded, and he&nbsp;gestured for her to&nbsp;park on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the road. But when the men also parked, they suddenly noticed that the woman’s car had disappeared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a1b/1f0/7d70575c25a830b847f3f15a83.png><p>They looked around the highway in&nbsp;shock. She couldn’t have gone somewhere far so&nbsp;fast. But the car was nowhere to&nbsp;be&nbsp;found. After some time, another man drove up&nbsp;to&nbsp;L.C. and Charlie. He&nbsp;saw everything that happened and claimed that the car had simply disappeared. The men talked about the incident for several hours.</p><p>When they reached the city, they contacted the police. However, the police couldn’t help them in&nbsp;any way&nbsp;— apart from their words, there was no&nbsp;confirmation of&nbsp;the existence of&nbsp;the car. The case was discussed for a&nbsp;while in&nbsp;local newspapers and then was forgotten. The Gadianton Canyon Incident.</p><p>This incident occurred in&nbsp;May 1972 in&nbsp;southeastern Utah near the Modena railroad crossing, on&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;the Escalante Desert. Jenna North was driving her father’s 1971 Chevrolet Nova. Her friend Carol Abbott was in&nbsp;the passenger seat. In&nbsp;the back seat, there were two other girls: Lisa Rochefort and Bethany Gordon.</p><p>It&nbsp;was after 10&nbsp;p.m. when the girls crossed the Utah-Nevada state line. They wanted to&nbsp;get back to&nbsp;campus before their housekeeper, Mrs. Mortensen, locked the dorm doors. This stretch of&nbsp;Highway 56&nbsp;in&nbsp;Utah is&nbsp;pretty deserted. There’s nothing there but sand and a&nbsp;few plants. The girls were very happy when they finally noticed the Union Pacific railroad crossing in&nbsp;Modena.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/21f/051/b94269516da6c849edbe93a4f2.png><p>But right behind the railing, Jenna noticed two highways: one went into the desert, and the other&nbsp;— to&nbsp;Gadianton Canyon. The girls decided to&nbsp;take the road to&nbsp;the canyon. They thought it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;shortcut to&nbsp;campus. The other girls were chatting with each other when Jenna noticed that they were no&nbsp;longer driving on&nbsp;asphalt, but on&nbsp;white cement. “Watch out!”, suddenly shouted one of&nbsp;the girls.</p><p>The road ended abruptly at&nbsp;a&nbsp;high rock wall. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;dead end. They had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back the same way they came here. And while Jenna’s friends were complaining that now they would have to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;the car, Jenna saw that the landscape had changed dramatically. They weren’t in&nbsp;the desert anymore. Instead, the canyon turned into an&nbsp;open area with wheat fields, pine thickets, and a&nbsp;small lake ahead. A&nbsp;full moon was shining in&nbsp;the sky, which was strange because it&nbsp;shouldn’t have been there that night.</p><p>The girls had no&nbsp;idea where they were, so&nbsp;they just drove to&nbsp;the light ahead. It&nbsp;was some building that they thought was a&nbsp;diner or&nbsp;restaurant. The girls saw a&nbsp;bright neon sign, but none of&nbsp;them could read what was written on&nbsp;it. These symbols were unlike any language they knew. Suddenly, several people came out of&nbsp;the building. They seemed shocked and frightened by&nbsp;Jenna’s Chevrolet.</p><p>They waved their hands and shouted something, but the girls didn’t understand them. Lisa decided to&nbsp;ask the men for directions. She stuck her head out of&nbsp;the window and... immediately let out a&nbsp;terrifying scream. “Get out of&nbsp;here!”, she shouted to&nbsp;Jenna. The Chevrolet sped away from the building. Bright headlights illuminated their car from behind. They were being chased by&nbsp;a&nbsp;few vehicles. These vehicles were “egg-shaped”, had three wheels, and made a&nbsp;buzzing sound.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/727/19e/1391435543a9a7f805c835038a.png><p>The road ahead led back to&nbsp;the canyon. Jenna didn’t have time to&nbsp;slow down and crashed right into&nbsp;it. The vehicles had disappeared together with an&nbsp;unfamiliar landscape. The girls were back in&nbsp;the desert again. Fortunately, none of&nbsp;them were hurt... Physically.</p><p>But Lisa was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;state of&nbsp;shock. She was saying again and again: “They weren’t human”. The girls had to&nbsp;help her walk. An&nbsp;hour later they were able to&nbsp;stop a&nbsp;Utah Highway Patrol car. They told the police their story. The details of&nbsp;the report compiled by&nbsp;the police officer were complicated and confusing. During the investigation, the police couldn’t figure out from the tire tracks exactly where the car went astray.</p><p>The tracks ended very abruptly as&nbsp;if&nbsp;the Chevrolet had suddenly disappeared. The police couldn’t explain how the car could’ve driven two miles without leaving any traces&nbsp;— especially on&nbsp;such solid ground. There are still disputes about this story, but in&nbsp;the end, all versions and explanations of&nbsp;what happened are just guesses. Perhaps we’ll never find out the truth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bd1/639/ccd690514ab54b1587b8ac366a.png><p>These were the urban legends about “interdimensional traveling”. Of&nbsp;course, there’s no&nbsp;proof that any of&nbsp;these stories are real. Often the truth turns out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very mundane. For example, the famous “man from Taured”, who people also called “a&nbsp;guest from another reality”, turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple fraudster named John Allen Kuchar Zegrus. But even&nbsp;so, these stories are still very interesting.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6v9OeqaKnpah6rq3NZp2rp51irm66zqdknrCZqMGmutNmmqimpJ67prrTZq6hp12srrR5x55kcWlla4N0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
