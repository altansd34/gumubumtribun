That family member’s identity is then revealed, similar to The Masked Singer.</p><p>During this week’s episode, former NFL wide receiver Terrell Owens was revealed to be the older brother of Sharmaine, as they performed a duet of “24K Magic” by Bruno Mars. Later, Train singer Pat Monahan was revealed to be the father of 11-year-old Rock. They performed “I Don’t Wanna Miss a Thing” by Aerosmith.</p><p>Finally, Real Housewives star Kyle Richards was revealed to be the mother of Sophia, as they sang “Love You Like a Love Song” by Selena Gomez.

Sophia shared that she’d never performed on such a big stage before, but she was “pushing myself to step out of my comfort zone.”</p><p>Sophia and her mystery relative (mom Kyle Richards) performed “Love You Like a Love Song” by Selena Gomez. Clues about Richards’ identity included the Beverly Hills sign and a photo of her Housewives co-star Denise Richards.</p><p>Tyler locked in his guess on the very last clue, meaning he would take home $10,000 if he was right. Unfortunately, his guess of Paris Hilton turned out to be wrong, as Richards emerged on stage to perform with her daughter.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original_MelB_Santiago-FelipeGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Mel B is Re Releasing Her Best-Selling 2018 Memoir ‘Brutally Honest’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kyle Richards</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>We Are Family</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGgnKBdmLKtscGroK2hlah6uLHRnmSrnaaarq2xw2amp2Wknba0edaenKSrXayybq3RnmSfmZ2eubp7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
