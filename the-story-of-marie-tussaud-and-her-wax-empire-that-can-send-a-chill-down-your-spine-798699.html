There’s a&nbsp;thrilling and somewhat eerie story behind&nbsp;it, and here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;can’t wait to&nbsp;share it&nbsp;with you.</p><p><h2>Marie Tussaud’s early life and wax modeling talent</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e99/95b/6793645bd29b85a48acdc8cd26.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Madame Tussaud, a&nbsp;portrait study by&nbsp;John T. Tussaud</p><p>Madame Tussaud was <a href=#>born</a> Marie Grosholtz in&nbsp;1761 in&nbsp;Strasbourg, France, shortly after her father, Joseph Grosholtz, was killed in&nbsp;the Seven Years’ War. She spent her childhood in&nbsp;Bern, Switzerland, in&nbsp;the house of&nbsp;the anatomist and wax modeler, Dr. Philippe Curtius, where her mother <a href=#>worked</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;housekeeper. Curtius, whom Marie called her uncle, taught her the art of&nbsp;wax modeling.</p><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15&nbsp;or 16, she <a href=#>did</a> her first waxwork&nbsp;— the figure of&nbsp;the philosopher, Voltaire. Later on, Tussaud <strong>created many figures of&nbsp;famous people of&nbsp;those times</strong>, including <a href=#>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> and <a href=#>Benjamin Franklin</a>. Marie also became a&nbsp;favorite at&nbsp;the palace of&nbsp;Versailles and taught modeling to&nbsp;Elizabeth, the sister of&nbsp;Louis XVI, the <a href=#>King</a> of&nbsp;France.</p><p><h2>The French Revolution and Madame Tussaud’s special role</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b50/4d6/3ae4d85a8bb525706e4353c527.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>A&nbsp;wax figure of&nbsp;Madame Marie Tussaud holding one of&nbsp;her creations</p><p>In&nbsp;1789, when the French Revolution broke out, both Marie Tussaud and her teacher, Philippe Curtius, were <a href=#>accused</a> of&nbsp;the royal sympathies. Marie was<a href=#> arrested</a> and her head was shaved to&nbsp;prepare her for the execution, but luckily, she was released thanks to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Curtius’ supporters.</p><p>During the hard times of&nbsp;the revolution, Tussaud and Curtius got a&nbsp;new, gruesome role&nbsp;— <strong>they would <a href=#>make</a> death masks</strong> of&nbsp;the people who were executed. Back in&nbsp;those days, photography still didn’t exist, and such masks were <a href=#>created</a> to&nbsp;keep the memory of&nbsp;the person alive after their death or&nbsp;were used further for painting portraits.</p><p>It’s believed that during this sad mission, Marie <a href=#>created</a> the masks of&nbsp;<a href=#>Louis XVI</a>, <a href=#>Marie Antoinette</a>, and <a href=#>Jean-Paul Marat</a>.</p><p><h2>The fame and legacy of&nbsp;Madame Tussaud</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/435/2a1/34cab65113baabf15f932b8b6c.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>A&nbsp;wax figure of&nbsp;Marie Tussaud</p><p>After Philip Curtius’ <a href=#>death</a> in&nbsp;1794, Marie Tussaud became the heir of&nbsp;his waxworks. In&nbsp;1795, Marie married civil engineer, François Tussaud. The couple <a href=#>had</a> 3&nbsp;children, a&nbsp;girl who died after birth and 2&nbsp;sons, Joseph and François. The relationship between the spouses grew tense, and when in&nbsp;1802, German illusionist Paul Philidor suggested Marie go&nbsp;to&nbsp;London and make a&nbsp;joined show, she agreed and left home with one of&nbsp;her sons. In&nbsp;London, Marie Tussaud, a&nbsp;talented wax artist in&nbsp;her forties, decided to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;business of&nbsp;her own.</p><p>Madame Tussaud <strong><a href=#>organized</a> a&nbsp;touring exhibition of&nbsp;her waxworks</strong> throughout the British Isles. In&nbsp;every city, her skillful works attracted many curious visitors and brought her fame and profit. In&nbsp;1822, Marie’s second son, François, joined his mother and brother and became part of&nbsp;the family wax business.</p><p>In&nbsp;1835, Madame Tussaud <a href=#>gave</a> her exhibition a&nbsp;permanent home in&nbsp;London. The museum, Madame Tussauds, still features some of&nbsp;the waxworks created by&nbsp;Marie Tussaud herself. With time, this mesmerizing collection of&nbsp;wax figures expanded and is&nbsp;now represented not only in&nbsp;London, but in&nbsp;Amsterdam, Beijing, Berlin, Sydney, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Shanghai, and many other cities.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;Marie Tussaud and her wax empire?
