A&nbsp;trail of&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-chosen perfume always compliments a&nbsp;lady’s style. It&nbsp;usually plays one of&nbsp;the key roles in&nbsp;her persona.” That’s why many famous people, not specifically women, pay attention to&nbsp;the choice of&nbsp;“the” perfume.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<b>Bright Side </b>wondered what some of&nbsp;the most legendary women of&nbsp;our past and present time chose to&nbsp;wear as&nbsp;their scent. We&nbsp;also found out which of&nbsp;these perfumes are still produced today and if&nbsp;we&nbsp;could really buy them.</p><p><h2>Princess Diana</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1fd/c5e/625bad5cdabed53cf5b846daa7.jpg><p>Princess Diana walked down the aisle <a href=#>bathed</a> in&nbsp;Quelques Fleurs by&nbsp;Houbigant Paris (on&nbsp;top). This flowery perfume was first produced in&nbsp;1913. The scent features notes of&nbsp;citrus fruits, jasmine, lilac, tuberous, and carnation. Quelques Fleurs was the first-ever perfume that featured several fragrances (outperforming even Chanel №&nbsp;5).</p><p>During the last few years of&nbsp;her life, the princess’ favorite was 24&nbsp;Faubourg by&nbsp;Hermès, created in&nbsp;1995. Diana’s personal makeup artist <a href=#>Mary Greenwell</a> <a href=#>confessed</a> that her famous client loved to&nbsp;wear this expensive perfume.</p><ul><li>Both perfumes are still being produced. A&nbsp;new version of&nbsp;Quelques Fleurs by&nbsp;Houbigant Paris was <a href=#>created</a> in&nbsp;2017. The classic version of&nbsp;24&nbsp;Faubourg is&nbsp;still popular today; you can find and buy it&nbsp;in&nbsp;any perfume store.</li></ul><p><h2>Marilyn Monroe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/137/251/7db1095bd39bdaf4cf13bb9089.jpg><p>When <a href=# title="Marilyn Monroe" data-link=tag>Marilyn Monroe</a> was asked what she wore in&nbsp;bed, she replied with the today-iconic phrase “Why, Chanel №&nbsp;5, of&nbsp;course.” This perfume was one of&nbsp;her favorites and is&nbsp;often associated with the actress’ name. However, in&nbsp;2002, reports had referred to&nbsp;the fact that during the shooting of&nbsp;Some Like It&nbsp;Hot, Monroe got Rose Geranium by&nbsp;Floris delivered to&nbsp;her Beverly Hills suite. There is&nbsp;even a&nbsp;<a href=#>receipt</a> that proves the fact.</p><ul><li>Perfume Rose Geranium has gone out of&nbsp;production and exists in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;essential oil for baths. Chanel №&nbsp;5, on&nbsp;the other side, has already had several new editions; one of&nbsp;them was created in&nbsp;2015.</li></ul><p><h2>Audrey Hepburn</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ce/6c1/116e6156f8b35fdca44a352d3f.jpg><p><a href=# title="Audrey Hepburn" data-link=tag>Audrey Hepburn</a> was Hubert de&nbsp;Givenchy’s muse&nbsp;— the head of&nbsp;the Givenchy fashion house. That’s why it’s not surprising that she favored Givenchy’s perfumes. Perfume L’Interdit was <a href=#>made especially for Audrey</a> in&nbsp;1957. The perfume’s name means “forbidden” in&nbsp;French. Its composition includes spices, citrus fruits, peach, and strawberry; the heart of&nbsp;the scent includes iris, violet, narcissus, ilang-ilang, lily of&nbsp;the valley, and rose.</p><p>Audrey Hepburn asked not to&nbsp;make L’Interdit publicly available (that’s how the perfume got its name). However, in&nbsp;1960, anyone could buy the famous scent. L’Interdit had become legendary in&nbsp;a&nbsp;blink of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye because all women wanted to&nbsp;smell like the famous Audrey Hepburn.</p><ul><li>We&nbsp;have a&nbsp;chance too because, in&nbsp;2003 and 2007, L’Interdit was re-launched. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to&nbsp;buy the fragrance in&nbsp;that same bottle design in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cabochon. Its modern design is&nbsp;much simpler&nbsp;— just a&nbsp;rectangular glass bottle with the Givenchy logo.</li></ul><p><h2>Elizabeth Taylor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d4a/091/4c2cb45948bcf7b1d6b6dff1ad.jpg><p>Today many celebrities have their own perfume lines, but Taylor pioneered in&nbsp;it&nbsp;with her own scent. <a href=# title="Elizabeth Taylor" data-link=tag>Elizabeth Taylor</a>’s brand created several successful perfumes among which are Black Pearls, Passion, Forever Elizabeth, White Diamonds, and more. <a href=#>White Diamonds</a> was chosen by&nbsp;the actress for herself (on&nbsp;the photo above she’s holding White Diamonds in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special collector’s edition with diamond-encrusted cap).</p><p>The actress also <a href=#>favored</a> a&nbsp;perfume called Bal а&nbsp;Versailles Jean Desprez, created in&nbsp;1962. It’s an&nbsp;oriental scent that includes 300&nbsp;ingredients; its main notes are sandalwood, patchouli, ilang-ilang, orange blossom, and vanilla.</p><ul><li>White Diamonds is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cult perfume that can be&nbsp;bought in&nbsp;any perfume store. As&nbsp;for Bal а&nbsp;Versailles Jean Desprez, it&nbsp;has long become a&nbsp;rare vintage: it’s no&nbsp;longer produced but many perfume enthusiasts can find and purchase&nbsp;it.</li></ul><p><h2>Grace Kelly</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/390/999/e124a15cce853c075be084cf7e.jpg><p><a href=# title="Grace Kelly" data-link=tag>Grace Kelly</a> was a&nbsp;true fan of&nbsp;Fleurissimo by&nbsp;the British perfume house Creed. It&nbsp;was specially <a href=#>ordered</a> for Kelly’s wedding and complimented the bride’s bouquet. Fleurissimo is&nbsp;a&nbsp;flowery scent that includes notes of&nbsp;bergamot, tuberose, Bulgarian rose, lily, and Florentine iris. The perfume house Creed still <a href=#>produces</a> the legendary perfume in&nbsp;its classic version.</p><p><h2>Catherine, Duchess of&nbsp;Cambridge</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/011/0cd/c03f4756798c468429292a284c.jpg><p>Kate Middleton’s favorite brand is&nbsp;Illuminum. It’s a&nbsp;British elite perfumery brand established in&nbsp;2007. Kate chose to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;perfume called <a href=#>White Gardenia Petals</a> on&nbsp;her wedding day with Prince William. It&nbsp;opens with notes of&nbsp;lily and bergamot, keeping gardenia, ilang-ilang, and jasmine in&nbsp;the heart.</p><ul><li>The perfume is&nbsp;being produced and anyone can purchase&nbsp;it. However, it&nbsp;belongs to&nbsp;the category of&nbsp;elite perfumes and is&nbsp;sold only in&nbsp;niche perfume shops.</li></ul><p><h2>Meghan, Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e2f/8dd/2885155765bd559a75d345ce1e.jpg><p>Meghan really loves perfumes. She even <a href=#>confessed</a> that if&nbsp;she left the house and forgot to&nbsp;use her perfume, she would definitely go&nbsp;back. As&nbsp;expected of&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the British Royal family, Meghan prefers British perfume houses. Her 2&nbsp;favorite perfumes are Wild Bluebell and Wood Sage &&nbsp;Sea Salt by&nbsp;the niche perfume brans Jo&nbsp;Malone. The first one is&nbsp;a&nbsp;flowery aroma with notes of&nbsp;lily of&nbsp;the valley and rosehip. The second one is&nbsp;woody aquatic. They are both natural and fresh.</p><p>For the wedding of&nbsp;Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, <a href=#>Floris London</a> perfume house created an&nbsp;exclusive perfume. It’s the main supplier of&nbsp;perfumes for the British Royal family. It’s a&nbsp;unisex perfume with aquatic and citrus notes.</p><ul><li>Meghan’s wedding perfume by&nbsp;Floris London became a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the private collection and therefore is&nbsp;not available to&nbsp;the public. The perfumes by&nbsp;Jo&nbsp;Malone, on&nbsp;the other hand, are available to&nbsp;anyone.</li></ul><p><h2>Penélope Cruz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/661/c2c/4a1b485df2a126fff768150799.jpg><p>Penélope Cruz has become a&nbsp;new face of&nbsp;the legendary ladies’ perfume Trésor by&nbsp;Lancome. In&nbsp;her <a href=#>interview</a>, she said she never leaves her house without a&nbsp;few drops of&nbsp;Trésor since her parents gave her this perfume on&nbsp;her 13th birthday. It’s a&nbsp;flowery perfume with notes of&nbsp;pineapple, peach, lilac, and rose. Besides the already classic scent, Lancome regularly re-launches and creates new versions of&nbsp;the perfume.</p><p><h2>Nicole Kidman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68e/176/5745d4541db7c466a052103461.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her interviews, Kidman <a href=#>said</a> that she loved to&nbsp;create her own unique aroma by&nbsp;mixing different essential oils. Her <a href=#>favorite</a> perfume is&nbsp;Angel created by&nbsp;Thierry Mugler. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;sweet composition that includes notes of&nbsp;bergamot, tropical fruits, vanilla, caramel, and patchouli.</p><ul><li>The first Angel was produced in&nbsp;1992. This perfume is&nbsp;still being produced and you can wear its unique aroma yourself.</li></ul><p><h2>Cameron Diaz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/715/cf3/e6b5ac58449399e8686becb8b0.jpg><p>Positive and cheerful Cameron really suits her <a href=#>favorite</a> perfume called Happy. It&nbsp;has been produced since 1997 and is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most successful perfumes created by&nbsp;Clinique. It’s a&nbsp;fruit-and-flower aroma with apple, plum, and bergamot tinges. The heart of&nbsp;the perfume contains the scents of&nbsp;freesia, rose, lily of&nbsp;the valley, and orchid.</p><ul><li>This perfume is&nbsp;quite popular and can be&nbsp;easily bought in&nbsp;perfume shops.</li></ul><p><h2>Madonna</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b5/816/66c01050cd974ed0da591d64cd.jpg><p>Madonna is&nbsp;a&nbsp;true perfume enthusiast. One of&nbsp;her <a href=#>favorites</a> is&nbsp;Hypnotic Poison by&nbsp;Dior. It&nbsp;has apricot, plum, and coconut tinges. The perfume’s heart is&nbsp;tuberose, jasmine, lily of&nbsp;the valley, rose, sandalwood, vanilla, and mucus.</p><p>Hypnotic Poison was created in&nbsp;1998; 2018 marks the 20th anniversary of&nbsp;the perfume. The bottle’s shape reminds of&nbsp;an&nbsp;apple that is&nbsp;associated with the forbidden fruit, Eve and Adam. The perfume’s aroma corresponds with its name; the French poet <a href=#>Paul Valéry</a> once said, “Perfume is&nbsp;a&nbsp;poison for the heart.”</p><ul><li>Hypnotic Poison can easily be&nbsp;bought in&nbsp;any perfume shop. The newest version of&nbsp;the perfume was produced in&nbsp;2014.</li></ul><p><h2>Vivien Leigh</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/408/6bf/3e10e256c6a6893726f5047603.jpg><p>Joy by&nbsp;Jean Patou was Vivien Leigh’s <a href=#>favorite</a>. It&nbsp;was created in&nbsp;1930 and became available to&nbsp;the public during the Great Depression. The perfume’s name and its aroma was a&nbsp;great contrast to&nbsp;the grim financial situation in&nbsp;the country and that’s how it&nbsp;became the symbol of&nbsp;hope. Joy was the most expensive one at&nbsp;that time. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;flowery aroma with Bulgarian and May roses and jasmine tinges. Decades later, the style icon of&nbsp;the 20th century, <a href=#>Jacqueline Kennedy</a>, called it&nbsp;her favorite.</p><ul><li>Today this legendary perfume is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer produced. However, perfume enthusiasts could try and find it&nbsp;for their collection.</li></ul><p>What is&nbsp;your favorite perfume?
