He’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">peck-popped</a> and danced his way into the hearts of millions of viewers ever since. His recent Instagram post hints that he’s ready for change and unsure if he will return to AGT.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-terry-crews-posts-about-potentially-leaving-agt-on-instagram>Terry Crews Posts About Potentially Leaving ‘AGT’ on Instagram</h2><p>“What a week. A lot of transition. The end of an era as 8 years of&nbsp;@nbcbrooklyn99&nbsp;came to an end last night,” he wrote. “Also hosted my 3rd season finale of&nbsp;@AGT&nbsp;on Wednesday which marks the end of my deal with all things&nbsp;@NBC. I have no idea what’s next. It’s been this way for&nbsp;@therealrebeccakingcrews&nbsp;and I for 32 years. Just asking God to go before us and show us the way. Letting infinite wisdom tell us just what to do.”</p><p>Crews waved goodbye to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooklyn&nbsp;Nine-Nine</a> last week after eight seasons. This was his longest-running acting role in his career so far. The series finale landed in the same week as the Season 16 AGT finale. Crews looked like he was having a blast on stage before crowning <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dustin Tavella</a> as the winner. None of us knew that it would potentially be his last time on AGT.</p><p>“If you can’t grow with me, then I have to grow on without you,” he wrote. “Nothing personal, it’s just recognizing to live a new life there are things and people you can’t take with you or they will pull you back into bad things, situations and outcomes.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CT8m2MsFqoF/</p></figure><p>Crews did say that he’s preparing for his “life’s next journey.” There is the potential of NBC signing him to a new deal or at least offering him one, but they’d have to put some big money on the table for Crews since he has an estimated net worth of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$25 million</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-s-next-for-crews>What’s Next For Crews?</h2><p>Crews’ post sparked mixed reactions from AGT fans. Some were very understanding that he probably wants to move on from his NBC era and pursue other opportunities.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Kseniya Simonova</a>, Crews’ first-ever Golden Buzzer wrote, “OMG. Are you leaving AGT? Nooooo…..” AGT contestants <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Roberta Battaglia</a>, The Curtis Family C-Notes, and Deadly Games all offered their support on his post.</p><p>Crews recently snagged a role in Rumble, an animated film produced by Paramount that will be released Feb. 18, 2022. He will voice the role of a monster named Tentacular. Crews could also be involved in other upcoming projects that have yet to be announced.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>In the meantime, Crews has hinted that he would like to have a<strong> </strong>Brooklyn&nbsp;Nine-Nine reunion at some point.</p><p>“Everybody wants to bring it back,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>. “And I’m ready. I’m already pitching ideas. Hey, let’s do a ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ movie; we could do one every year!”</p><p>There could be a chance that he channels this same energy into returning to AGT. If it is the end of Crews hosting, he deserves major props. He has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">entertained the crowd</a>, handled revealing results with ease, and truly makes the acts feel comfortable backstage.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rich-FuryGetty-Images.jpeg alt="RuPaul Officially Has Most Emmys of Any Black Artist in History" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yKxkrZ2ip8Zur9GerqxllKS7pnnWoquhZZGisrO1wpqqZp%2BfqXq1rcuepa1lpJ2ybrTOrKtmoJmjwbR5x55ksKGcoXqvu9NmqZ6spae7cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
