And when Erica, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>35</a>, lost her first husband, she and her kids had to&nbsp;gather their strength, face their harsh reality, and trust that a&nbsp;brighter future was waiting for them.

And even though they were blessed with a&nbsp;wonderful reason to&nbsp;smile again, this beautiful big <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>family</a> had to&nbsp;face and overcome one of&nbsp;life’s deepest sorrows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/019/8aa/a09b4357d6b8dc822ac3e4fb48.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2016, Erica lost her <a href=# title=beloved data-link=tag>beloved</a> husband <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tony</a>, who was&nbsp;31, after 8&nbsp;years of&nbsp;bravely fighting a&nbsp;disease. He&nbsp;was her best friend, her husband, and the father of&nbsp;their 7&nbsp;children. In&nbsp;fact, at&nbsp;the time, Erica was still pregnant with their last child. And 4&nbsp;months later, she gave birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong and healthy baby boy, who she named Caleb.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/62e/0d9/f2ef195dd59fbc73442ed5ff38.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the months passed, Erica’s young family gave her the strength, purpose, and motivation to&nbsp;carry on&nbsp;even though the memory of&nbsp;her adored husband Tony never left her. She found true joy in&nbsp;caring for each of&nbsp;her children. And each day she woke up&nbsp;looking forward to&nbsp;taking another step in&nbsp;this world right beside them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/62c/b23/33057056698a26e0a45d7de68a.jpg><p>By&nbsp;throwing herself into motherhood, she felt fulfilled by&nbsp;where she was standing in&nbsp;her life. She even became happy once again and accepted her present situation.</p><p>And about a&nbsp;year after her loss, Erica’s friends were finally able to&nbsp;convince her, after months of&nbsp;persistence, to&nbsp;join a&nbsp;singles event. This is&nbsp;how she became a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;an&nbsp;online support group for young widows and met Spencer, the new man who would soon change her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/665/591/2bae7e537295815dcc10b48bcd.jpg><p>In&nbsp;fact, this young father had also experienced a&nbsp;similar story of&nbsp;grief. He&nbsp;had unexpectedly lost his wife and was left alone to&nbsp;raise his 4&nbsp;children.</p><p>But dating, let alone getting married again, was far from Erica’s plans for the future. However, she very quickly felt at&nbsp;ease with Spencer and spent long hours chatting with him. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, “Spencer and&nbsp;I connect on&nbsp;such a&nbsp;deep spiritual level. It’s almost like we’d been friends for years, and we&nbsp;hadn’t even met in&nbsp;person yet.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b5/071/61ec0e5cd9a4e3962e8a734076.jpg><p>After 5&nbsp;months of&nbsp;speaking online, the pair were finally able to&nbsp;meet, and their face-to-face <a href=# title=bond data-link=tag>bond</a> felt even stronger. When she met him in&nbsp;person, Erica <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noticed</a> that the young father was ’’mild-mannered and kind and complimentary, and very good-looking.’’</p><p>Clearly the feelings were mutual, as&nbsp;Spencer expressed his desire to&nbsp;date her, but the mother of&nbsp;7&nbsp;wasn’t ready yet and preferred to&nbsp;stay friends instead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/257/f46/41b36450088cee342f8ab185f8.jpg><p>A&nbsp;few months passed, and their kids also became close, especially their 2&nbsp;oldest boys, who were both 10-years-old. And their parents’ bond even grew tighter with time.</p><p>Erica <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acknowledged</a> that she felt that same “enriching, deep connection you only feel with a&nbsp;spouse” with Spencer. And, when she looked into his eyes, she sensed the same comforting emotion of&nbsp;being “at&nbsp;home” just as&nbsp;she did with Tony. This is&nbsp;when Erica understood that they should be&nbsp;together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/129/216/bd24ce54c9baa39dfcdebf1429.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/88b/316/bd4dff5d8fab9a1cd0f425edf5.jpg><p>She opened up&nbsp;to&nbsp;Spencer, and he&nbsp;was ecstatic to&nbsp;finally hear those words. It&nbsp;seemed that destiny had brought them together to&nbsp;give love another chance.</p><p>And on&nbsp;a&nbsp;“bright and cold winter day,” the lovely couple tied the knot. The big day was filled with joy and the cheerful dancing of&nbsp;their 11&nbsp;kids, ages 2&nbsp;to&nbsp;10.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/422/34d/ed086051a787b6cd3ad01cb996.jpg><p>Today, after more than 3&nbsp;years since their union, Erica <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>describes</a> the love in&nbsp;their family as ’’strong, unique, healing, and even magical.’’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4b/b58/998cf45d9eb08026d93a21f691.jpg><p>The happy 35-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>notes</a>, ’’My once shattered heart from the loss of&nbsp;Tony not only healed, but it&nbsp;grew larger than&nbsp;I could ever imagine.’’ She explains that Spencer and Tony don’t each own half of&nbsp;her soul. But that she loves each one of&nbsp;them “COMPLETELY, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful way.”</p><p>When she looks back at&nbsp;her journey, the mama says that it&nbsp;has ’’enriched her family with an&nbsp;appreciation for the present and a&nbsp;reverence for the past.’’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b80/15b/cd46d15cb5bca8f3a937302e28.jpg><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;Erica’s and Spencer’s life story and their blended family?
