If you more readily associate cherry blossom season with Japan, you might be surprised to learn that there are lots of places to see the sakura trees bloom in Central Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>The cherry blossom season in Germany is brief—on average, the trees bloom for only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ten days</a>— but the fleetingness of the beauty makes it all the more special. You can usually catch the trees blooming in April, though the exact time varies from year to year. We’ve picked the four best places to see the cherry blossoms in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany</a>, so you can be ready the next time they bloom.&nbsp;</p><li><a href=#>Bonn</a></li><li><a href=#>Berlin</a></li><li><a href=#>Hamburg</a></li><li><a href=#>Munich</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Bonn>1. Bonn</h2><p>The university city of Bonn spends a few short weeks each year enjoying its status as one of Germany’s prettiest cities. When the cherry blossoms come out during the spring, they coat Bonn in pink petals and attract visitors from all over the country. People flock to Heerstraße in the Nordstadt neighborhood, which has come to be known as Cherry Blossom Avenue thanks to the densely pink trees that form a whimsical tunnel over the street.&nbsp;</p><p>Bonn hasn’t exactly hidden its light under a bushel when it comes to its cherry blossoms, so expect to witness the spectacle alongside many others. Embrace it, and think of it like the cherry blossom parties in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>Not sure when to plan your visit? Keep an eye on when the trees are expected to bloom on the city of Bonn’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Berlin>2. Berlin</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Berlin</a> has a special connection with cherry blossoms. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Japanese broadcaster Asahi TV collected donations the next year to fund the purchase of cherry blossom trees for the city. The campaign was so successful that thousands of trees were planted, and they now bloom at many sites where the Wall formerly divided the city (not to mention several other public places). The trees have helped to beautify the city and symbolize renewal and optimism.&nbsp;</p><p>Berlin’s two main Cherry Blossom Avenues are on the trail that follows where the Berlin Wall once stood, otherwise known as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mauerweg</a>. One is near Bornholmer Straße and the other is near the Lichterfelde Süd S-Bahn station. There are many other chances to see the trees throughout the city; download <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Visit Berlin</a>’s free map showing the locations.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also two cherry blossom festivals held in Berlin every year: the Japanese-style <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirschblütenfestival</a> and the festival at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gärten der Welt</a>. Check out their Facebook pages for the exact dates.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Hamburg>3. Hamburg</h2><p>The cherry blossom trees in Hamburg were another gift from Japan. This time they arrived from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hamburg</a>’s sister city, Osaka, in the 1960s as a symbol of friendship.&nbsp;</p><p>Since 1968, Hamburg has hosted the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirschblütenfest</a> (Cherry Blossom Festival) to celebrate the blooms and the city’s kinship with Osaka with music, fireworks and more. You can see the cherry blossoms in Hamburg in lovely Alsterpark, Kennedy Bridge and Alsterkrugchaussee, among other places.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Munich>4. Munich</h2><p>The final place on our list of places to see cherry blossoms in Germany is the Bavarian city of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Munich</a>. One of the city’s best areas to see cherry blossom trees is Olympiapark, where the vibrant trees are scattered around the grounds. Westpark is also home to several trees, especially near the Thai Sala.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where will you spend the next cherry blossom season?</h2><p>Though it was hard to cherry-pick just four places in Germany to see the blossoms, we consider these the very best. Head to Bonn to see some of Germany’s most vibrant cherry blossoms, or visit Berlin to bask under the colorful petals and soak up a sense of history. Celebrate friendship in Hamburg while attending the cherry blossom festival, or wander through Munich and let the pops of pink brighten up your day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
