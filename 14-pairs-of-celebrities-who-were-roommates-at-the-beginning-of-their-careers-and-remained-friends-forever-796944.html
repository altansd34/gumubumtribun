Something similar happened with <a href=# title="Ben Affleck" data-link=tag>Ben Affleck</a> and <a href=# title="Matt Damon" data-link=tag>Matt Damon</a> when they moved into an&nbsp;<a href=#>apartment</a> in&nbsp;<a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a> together&nbsp;— little did they know, they had a&nbsp;very promising future ahead of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we’re recalling great friendships that were born by&nbsp;sharing a&nbsp;bathroom when most of&nbsp;these famous people were just “aspirants.”</p><p><h2>1. Michael Douglas and Danny DeVito</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6dd/69e/fd24f850eeaaa3c42e1e760e09.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most endearing relationships in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> is&nbsp;that of&nbsp;Douglas and DeVito. It&nbsp;started back in&nbsp;the 1960s when they were just dreaming about making it&nbsp;big. They met at&nbsp;acting school in ’66 and were <a href=#>roommates </a>in ’68. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;time when they were “<a href=#>hippies</a>” doing “crazy stuff.” They got to&nbsp;work together in&nbsp;several films and their friendship has continued to&nbsp;grow over the years.</p><p><h2>2. Poppy Delevingne and Sienna Miller</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fe/4cd/67232256f7bbf2296c7703aa11.jpg><p>Sienna Miller and Poppy Delevingne shared a&nbsp;<a href=#>flat</a> in&nbsp;New York years ago and still remain very close friends. Miller always appreciated that Delevingne didn’t take herself too <a href=#>seriously</a>. And Delevingne <a href=#>considers</a> Miller “a&nbsp;sister from another mister.” These women share a&nbsp;long-lasting, sincere friendship and always make time to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;with each other.</p><p><h2>3. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d5/fac/d5fe735131b618401c17129aee.jpg><p>Ben Affleck was 8&nbsp;years old <a href=#>when</a> he&nbsp;met Matt Damon who was 10&nbsp;at the time. It&nbsp;was the start of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best Hollywood friendships where the pair would pursue their acting careers together. They traveled to&nbsp;New York together for <a href=#>acting</a> auditions and saved money for train and airline tickets in&nbsp;a&nbsp;joint bank account.</p><p>Success came to&nbsp;both of&nbsp;them thanks to&nbsp;their film, <a href=#>Good Will Hunting</a>. Damon moved into Affleck’s Los Angeles apartment and they began working on&nbsp;the script during improvisation sessions. They eventually <a href=#>won </a>both a&nbsp;Golden Globe Award and an&nbsp;Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has described this period of&nbsp;his life as&nbsp;“<a href=#>dreamlike</a>.”</p><p><h2>4. Tommy Lee Jones and Al&nbsp;Gore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f6/6ed/8ec8645ab0a5befa3b5f7e2ffd.jpg><p>The great actor and future vice president crossed paths as&nbsp;roommates at&nbsp;Harvard University. It&nbsp;turned out that chance led them to&nbsp;<a href=#>share</a> a&nbsp;room during their demanding studies in&nbsp;the Dunster House. Although their professional careers would lead them on&nbsp;very different paths, what they shared together in&nbsp;college is&nbsp;truly unshakable.</p><p><h2>5. Robin Williams and Christopher Reeve</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e35/478/412c3f5d76908d9fbca0094cb8.jpg><p>Their coexistence lasted only a&nbsp;year while studying at&nbsp;Juilliard School. Nevertheless, their friendship stayed strong until the end of&nbsp;their days. As&nbsp;proof of&nbsp;this, Reeve is&nbsp;the <a href=#>godfather</a> of&nbsp;Williams’ oldest son, Zachary.</p><p>In&nbsp;his 1999&nbsp;autobiography, <a href=#>Still Me</a>, Reeve wrote that a&nbsp;few days after being thrown from his horse, Williams <a href=#>arrived</a> in&nbsp;his room, dressed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor. It&nbsp;was the first time since the accident that Reeve laughed. Is&nbsp;there any better way to&nbsp;show what friends can do&nbsp;for&nbsp;us?</p><p><h2>6. Ilana Glazer and Rachel Bloom</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d77/7d2/d4daaa5a448486fe913aa792e4.jpg><p>Bloom and Glazer roomed <a href=#>together</a> after college in&nbsp;New York. For more than a&nbsp;year, they shared experiences of&nbsp;the beginnings of&nbsp;their careers on&nbsp;the sofa of&nbsp;their apartment in&nbsp;<a href=#>Brooklyn</a>. As&nbsp;Rachel Bloom reminded<a href=#>&nbsp;</a>us in&nbsp;a&nbsp;kissy post on&nbsp;Instagram, both besties managed to&nbsp;fulfill their dreams and now both have their own&nbsp;TV <a href=#>shows</a>.</p><p><h2>7. Ryan Gosling and Justin Timberlake</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ee/d12/8e380e5ad3adae0b9a85b9169c.jpg><p><a href=# title="Ryan Gosling" data-link=tag>Ryan Gosling</a> and <a href=# title="Justin Timberlake" data-link=tag>Justin Timberlake</a> began their careers at&nbsp;a&nbsp;tender age. They starred on&nbsp;the ‘90s show, <a href=#>The Mickey Mouse Club</a>, and from that point&nbsp;on, their friendship on&nbsp;and off-screen started to&nbsp;grow. Gosling’s family lived in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a> and the only way the little boy could make his dreams come true would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;live at&nbsp;Timberlake’s house. And believe it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, Timberlake’s mother let him move in&nbsp;and even <a href=#>agreed</a> to&nbsp;tutor Gosling during the filming of&nbsp;the show.</p><p>As&nbsp;Timberlake explained, they were probably a&nbsp;little closer than the rest of&nbsp;the kids that were on&nbsp;the show just <a href=#>because</a> they had to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;bathroom. That really creates a&nbsp;special bond, doesn’t it?</p><p><h2>8. Holly Hunter and Frances McDormand</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b06/836/5ae88c5635acf27cea47b184e9.jpg><p>They met through their boyfriends when they were in&nbsp;their twenties. When they <a href=#>split up</a>&nbsp;with their partners they decided to&nbsp;move forward to&nbsp;the next chapter of&nbsp;their lives together by&nbsp;moving into a&nbsp;joint apartment. They ended up&nbsp;<a href=#>sharing</a> that place for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years until Frances moved in&nbsp;with her future husband.</p><p>They keep fond memories of&nbsp;those single times when they were searching for their first roles. A&nbsp;few years later, the actresses worked alongside each other in&nbsp;<a href=#>Raising Arizona</a>.</p><p><h2>9. Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr. and Kiefer Sutherland</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/155/d51/4a0f6f5a758d052a92f562db2c.jpg><p>This pair was roommates for 3&nbsp;years when they decided to&nbsp;try their luck in&nbsp;the Hollywood universe. Time and experience forced them to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know each other well and create a&nbsp;bond that would last forever.</p><p>Sutherland <a href=#>described</a> Downey as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“disciplined guy” and recalled that their friendship meant lending the other a&nbsp;shoulder to&nbsp;cry on&nbsp;in&nbsp;bad times, like when Downey suffered heartbreak after his split with Sara Jessica Parker back in&nbsp;1991.</p><p><h2>10. Lauren Graham and Connie Britton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ddb/6e6/552d2354d084903d812fe86dff.jpg><p>Both were in&nbsp;the same acting class in&nbsp;New York City and became fast <a href=#>friends</a>. They both decided to&nbsp;give the big move to&nbsp;Los Angeles a&nbsp;shot. In&nbsp;their apartment, they shared a&nbsp;time in&nbsp;their lives when everything seemed possible&nbsp;— they were just trying to&nbsp;chase their dreams.</p><p>Graham <a href=#>admitted</a> that they had no&nbsp;furniture and all they ate were Rice Krispies Treats. This was just a&nbsp;small detail of&nbsp;their past compared to&nbsp;their great <a href=#>party</a> memories together.</p><p><h2>11. Judd Apatow and Adam Sandler</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bf5/fc9/2f88f65b04907814c0d0b68e65.jpg><p>Both these talented men <a href=#>shared</a> a&nbsp;$900-a-month apartment in&nbsp;the valley when they struggled as&nbsp;comedians, long before they took over Hollywood making&nbsp;us laugh. Eventually, Apatow became a&nbsp;director and producer; and Sandler, an&nbsp;actor.</p><p>The memories they share from this time in&nbsp;their youth when they toured clubs <a href=#>doing </a>their comedy shows have served as&nbsp;inspiration for the film, <a href=#>Funny People</a>, which they both worked&nbsp;on. Those were the times when they considered eating at&nbsp;Red Lobster once every month a&nbsp;big night out, and Sandler would make prank phone <a href=#>calls </a>to&nbsp;friends while Apatow filmed it&nbsp;all.</p><p><h2>12. Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/106/e81/0ca52d51ae8dcaae4f38a23681.jpg><p>They were roommates in&nbsp;Hawai while filming the movie, <a href=#>Aloha</a> which resulted in&nbsp;them developing a&nbsp;special bond. As&nbsp;Cooper <a href=#>explained</a>, they got to&nbsp;know each other very well. Meanwhile, for Stone, there were only 2&nbsp;options: “You’re forced to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know them or&nbsp;hate them.” But judging by&nbsp;the photographs from behind the scenes of&nbsp;the film, it’s safe to&nbsp;say they understood each other.</p><p><h2>13. Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfb/9b3/85aa6e5a92b48d5f40a6d8c275.jpg><p>Another example of&nbsp;a&nbsp;productive, long-lasting friendship is&nbsp;that of&nbsp;Wilson and Anderson. They went to&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Texas together, <a href=#>sharing</a> a&nbsp;room and a&nbsp;friendship for years. They took advantage of&nbsp;that time together by&nbsp;co-writing the 1996&nbsp;film, <a href=#>Bottle Rocket</a>. But the path was not easy and after the film failed to&nbsp;achieve success, Owen Wilson even <a href=#>considered</a> joining the Marines.</p><p><h2>14. Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/01d/1b2/01f56c5d7899b8b63c6abff2e2.jpg><p>Their friendship began more than 5&nbsp;decades ago when they <a href=#>met</a> while taking acting classes and bunked up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;1-bedroom apartment in&nbsp;New York. Both tried to&nbsp;get their acting career off the ground while doing a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;odd jobs. Hoffman <a href=#>confessed</a> that in&nbsp;those years, he&nbsp;worked in&nbsp;a&nbsp;psychiatric hospital, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sales assistant in&nbsp;Macy’s toy department, and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;weaver of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hawaiian data-link=tag>Hawaiian</a> garlands.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know any other actors who have great friendships after living together? In&nbsp;your experience, have you continued to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;close relationship with your old roomies?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH51ec%2BaoKurXaSzbq%2FEpZybqpmptqa%2FjLCfqGWnmr%2BmedGopqalkamytHnArWStoJVir6azyKeloqaXYrynedOhnKKqXZius7HEq6pmmZ6ZerOxzJqgp52UYrOztcSnm6xllqS%2FpsLEq2RwcWZugXV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
