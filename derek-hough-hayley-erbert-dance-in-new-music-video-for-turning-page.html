This time, the couple appears together in the music video for “Turning Page” by Sleeping at Last. It’s been a long time coming, since the song was released on the Twilight: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 soundtrack in 2011.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-derek-hough-hayley-erbert-star-in-new-music-video>Derek Hough, Hayley Erbert Star in New Music Video</h2><p>The music video starts with Hough and Erbert dancing a passionate routine on a sand-covered platform. Things then expand to feature even more dancers, who are paired off for emotional dance vignettes. The images speed up, slow down, and are even shown backwards at certain points.</p><p>The “Turning Page” music video was co-directed by Hough and Phillip Chbeeb, who competed on So You Think You Can Dance. Chbeeb and his wife Makenzie Dustman choreographed the video, which premiered Tuesday on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>“We wanted to create a video about love and how life is a fleeting journey, an impermanent dance between birth and death. Like the sands of time we eventually return to the earth,” Hough told the outlet of the video’s concept, adding that “the essence of life lies in cherishing and embracing love during our brief experience.”</p><p>Cheeb explained the symbolism of the video’s set, saying, “The spinning platform represents the movement of time, and the sand represents a formless source from which all forms spring and return.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DEREK HOUGH IS TYING THE KNOT WITH HAYLEY ERBERT IN 2023</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-song-turning-page-was-featured-in-twilight>The Song ‘Turning Page’ Was Featured in Twilight</h2><p>“Turning Page” was featured in the 2011 movie Twilight: Breaking Dawn – Part 1, during Bella and Edward’s wedding. Sleeping at Last’s Ryan O’Neal told EW that he only considered creating a video for the song at “the beginning of this year.”</p><p>He knew he wanted Hough to be involved, and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing with the Stars judge</a> “completely ran with it.” Hough told him that he and Erbert were fans of the song, which “had been a part of their relationship.” O’Neal said the video turned out to be “exactly what I’d hope for and a million times more.”</p><p>The singer-songwriter wrote “Turning Page” as a blind submission for the movie’s soundtrack. He was inspired by his relationship with his wife, while adding language fitting to vampires — such as waiting a hundred years for someone.</p><p>Six months later, O’Neal learned that the song would be featured twice in the film. He said of attending the film’s premiere and hearing his song, “It was really a highlight, life moment for me.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_BlakeShelton_JasonAldean_Kevin-MazurWireImage-220x147.jpeg alt="Fake Article Claims Blake Shelton Canceled a Project to Support Jason Aldean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Derek Hough</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w56pnqNdnby2s8dmn5qxnJrGbrHRm5yrrF2Zrq%2BvxGagp2WemsRuudSsoJxlpp6xpruMn6arZaSqv6%2B1zaBkqZmXmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
