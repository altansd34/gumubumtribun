However, success is&nbsp;not the most important thing they share&nbsp;— the bond that unites them seems to&nbsp;grow stronger and stronger.</p><p><h2>Her father has always been a&nbsp;role model for her.</h2></p><p>Since she was a&nbsp;child, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Shakira</a> showed an&nbsp;innate interest in&nbsp;poetry and <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a>. This passion was influenced by&nbsp;her father, who would sit and create stories on&nbsp;a&nbsp;typewriter while his daughter was fascinated by&nbsp;his creativity. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;eight, she composed the song “Tus gafas oscuras” [Your dark glasses] for him, as&nbsp;he, after losing one of&nbsp;his sons in&nbsp;an&nbsp;accident, wore glasses for a&nbsp;year to&nbsp;hide the pain of&nbsp;his loss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5b/32e/0f1b915d599691517a894e1312.jpg><p>William also sparked her interest in&nbsp;her family’s cultural roots. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;four, he&nbsp;took her to&nbsp;a&nbsp;local Middle Eastern restaurant, where she had her first encounter with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>doumbek</i></a>, a&nbsp;traditional drum used in&nbsp;Middle Eastern music and often accompanying belly dancing. The experience was transformative for Shakira. Moved by&nbsp;the rhythm and melody, she decided that the stage would be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her life.</p><p><h2>Humanitarian values are another inheritance from her father.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/178/036/98f76f5b5181fa291075ef985c.jpg><p>Her father also took it&nbsp;upon himself to&nbsp;awaken Shakira’s generosity by&nbsp;taking her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child to&nbsp;a&nbsp;home so&nbsp;that she could see the orphans who lived there. This experience left a&nbsp;deep impression on&nbsp;her, and she promised herself that when she became a&nbsp;famous artist, she would help these children in&nbsp;need, just as&nbsp;<a href=#>she</a> does today.</p><p>She has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> how seeing her father in&nbsp;his 90s, she contemplates that beyond the success of&nbsp;her songs, her own humanity is&nbsp;the legacy that matters to&nbsp;her. Following her father’s footsteps, she wonders, “Have I&nbsp;listened to&nbsp;others enough when grief afflicted them? Have I&nbsp;celebrated their joys? Have I&nbsp;understood and forgiven their limitations?”</p><p><h2>Success and mutual admiration have been key to&nbsp;their relationship.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2007, Shakira <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had</a> a&nbsp;remarkable opportunity to&nbsp;collaborate with Gabriel García Márquez on&nbsp;the film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Love in&nbsp;the Time of&nbsp;Cholera</i></a>, based on&nbsp;the author’s acclaimed novel of&nbsp;the same name. The singer mentioned that thanks to&nbsp;that project, she wrote two of&nbsp;her best songs of&nbsp;that time: “Hay amores” and “Despedida.”</p><p>This significant event in&nbsp;the Colombian singer’s career was shared with her father, as&nbsp;they later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>did</a> a&nbsp;version of&nbsp;the song “Hay amores,” which strengthened their family bond. This is&nbsp;further proof of&nbsp;the importance that her father has had in&nbsp;her artistic career.</p><p><h2>At&nbsp;91&nbsp;years of&nbsp;age, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;surrounded by&nbsp;love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64d/0ae/6c06195c5cb59c334d495de56d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;difficult times, family ties remain strong, and even Gerard Piqué, with whom the singer had a&nbsp;great <a href=#>love story</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>visited</a> William when he&nbsp;was hospitalized in&nbsp;Spain. On&nbsp;his state of&nbsp;health, after facing several problems in&nbsp;the last year, including an&nbsp;accidental fall and two operations, his wife has told the media that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;stable.</p><p>Amid these difficult moments, Shakira has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shown</a> on&nbsp;her social media part of&nbsp;the therapeutic process that her father has been going through, and in&nbsp;which she has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>providing</a> all her support through her care and love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aae/2ee/f09f9d5e30bbec29528a4b54c8.jpg><p>The artist considers her father a&nbsp;“<a href=# title=hero data-link=tag>hero</a>” and has expressed her admiration for his resilience, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;has been recovering from a&nbsp;delicate health condition. Recently, in&nbsp;the storm of&nbsp;the <a href=#>separation</a> from Piqué, she left Spain to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;Miami to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;her father, who now requires a&nbsp;new operation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCprcqiqZpll5bDpnnUqWShnaJitbC5xGarqGWcpLysecCfq56qXZ2ys3mYamSynZGnerC4w2abmpxdbX50f5FxZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
