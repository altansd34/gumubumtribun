Could a three-headed dragon mean the second trio in the show’s history? Either way, Hydra definitely made an impact with their all-out performance.</b></span></p><p id=block-bfef0286-e2ab-4b55-8408-6c83fbeea594>So are there three celebrities under the mask? Or more, or less? Let’s get to the bottom of who the Hydra really is.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4492b8c3-1994-46ff-a8ca-9a7ffa2a9a2b>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 7</h2><p id=block-cef1140d-45af-4046-ad0f-8db43b323d4a>In Hydra’s clues, we’re taken to BAD BOY BEACH. They start with a commercial and you can see the Men in Black around them holding their noses and fanning the air, as if they’re smelling something bad. A drawing of a shark in a splash of water is shown. Hydra introduces Triple Head Gum, which ended their “smoky bad breath” forever. Graphics pop up to make it look like Hydra is blowing purple bubbles with the gum. Then, the camera pans out and we see skis with Miami written on them.</p><p id=block-f07b9acd-3d2a-4301-96a0-b08617c0c468>Men in Black are playing with beach balls, until Hydra hits one to the ground and stomps on it. We see a picture of a bull on the beach ball. Hydra mentions making sure that “fresh flavor is on the cards.” One of the Men in Black picks up a magic “3” ball and when he turns it around, it says “ASK YOUR AMIGOS.” Finally, we see an ATM before the commercial and clues package ends, and Hydra bets you’ll “bust away bad breath.”</p><p>After their first performance, Nick asked if three heads are better than one and Hydra responded, “Would you like to step inside and find out?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAKfseDDKXY</p>The Masked Singer Hydra performs “Hey Soul Sister” by Train</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-0e186ea3-2d4d-4059-a1a8-9680779fface>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Hydra</h2><p id=block-010185e0-f242-46ff-bf60-bb562e63dcc3>Most of the judges actually came to a consensus on this! At least Ken and Robin did. They both thought this was a trio of Martin Short, Steven Martin, and Chevy Chase. Jenny went out on a limb, guessing John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, and Steve Buscemi from The Big Lebowski.</p><p id=block-dbaa38ac-1503-4f81-8eb1-3a3988645fa2>On the Internet, many fans agree that it could be the “Three Amigos” stars under the masks. Magician duo Penn & Teller is another popular guess, along with John Goodman and Billy Crystal, who paired together to voice the main characters in Monsters Inc. One out-there guess we’ve seen a few times is three Muppets, including some combo of the Electric Mayhem or Fozzie, Gonzo, and Animal. That wouldn’t be so out of the question, since <a href=#>Kermit</a> has been on the show before!</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-c2039499-6ca3-4f1a-943f-7b45721603cb><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;ROUND 1 FINALS RECAP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-2ac1fb91-125a-40c3-b499-8072bcf8fb61>Who is the Hydra on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-e0ca94af-52ab-4cc6-927f-a44b15bb6bd3>Now this one is definitely meant to be some trickery. Three heads, but only two arms and two feet?! How many people are in there anyway? Well, from listening to the voices and tracking movement, we think the three heads could be a distraction.</p><p id=block-8da5cef0-b299-4771-bb79-e7db446b1c45>Yes, we actually think there are only TWO celebrities under the Hydra masks and they are…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-2531851d-b6c1-4663-8ab0-c2de0cd6681d><strong>Penn & Teller!</strong></h2><p id=block-7aef398b-d07f-46e9-8a8a-2bd70b03e587>As crazy as it sounds, all the clues line up! And this would perfectly fit into Penn & Teller’s history of smoke in mirrors. Now, let’s go through the clues that led us to them.</p><p id=block-e73f3c70-8faf-4525-b6bf-1affe5603258>First of all, there’s definitely a voice in there that sounds like Penn’s! Teller doesn’t speak too often, but it doesn’t seem crazy to assume he could be the other voice. The shark clue could be pointing to the “Off the Deep End” special where they escape from a straight-jacket in shark-infested water. There were many clues alluding to magic as well, including the magic 3 ball and the mention of cards. Hydra also said “bust away” which is also a term used in Vegas card games.</p><p id=block-c1cfd203-23f6-4693-817f-6490a797e706>The skis with Miami written on them could be a reference to Penn & Teller’s first TV appearances, which were both on the show Miami Vice. The beach ball with a bull on it could be referring to another show of theirs, Penn & Teller: Bullshit!. And finally, there’s a clue directly linking to Teller’s name and that’s the ATM that was displayed.</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-97e3c9b2-4525-4d3d-882e-f82bd1618ab1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;FIREFLY</a> | <a href=#>ARMADILLO</a> | <a href=#>MISS TEDDY</a> | <a href=#>RINGMASTER</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NUP_195977_01578.jpg alt="‘The Voice’s Jeremy Rosado Signs With First Company Management" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZiusbOtjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
