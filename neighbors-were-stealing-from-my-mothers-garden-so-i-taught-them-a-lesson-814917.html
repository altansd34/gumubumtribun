That’s why it’s especially frustrating when someone breaks in&nbsp;and ruins the results of&nbsp;your work. The hero of&nbsp;this story felt sorry for his mother who <a href=# title=invested data-link=tag>invested</a> a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time and effort into her garden while some strangers just chose to&nbsp;destroy&nbsp;it. So, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;teach them a&nbsp;lesson.</p><p>This is&nbsp;what the man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> about what happened, “My&nbsp;mom is&nbsp;really into gardening, and sometimes people come by&nbsp;and steal potted <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a>, yard statuettes, and even dig whole plant bulbs with plants out of&nbsp;the ground. Or&nbsp;cut all the roses off her bushes because they are too cheap to&nbsp;buy from the florist I&nbsp;guess.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e6f/bc5/5f93535a50a73941689c538c78.jpg><p>“Anyway my&nbsp;dash cam of&nbsp;my&nbsp;car which&nbsp;I park in&nbsp;the driveway near the garden bed caught most all of&nbsp;them close-up and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;help my&nbsp;mom not have her plants stolen&nbsp;I printed all their pictures out and made a&nbsp;poster that said, ’Oh, hey there! Don’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;Daffy-dil and steal, or&nbsp;else you might end up&nbsp;doing hard Thyme! We&nbsp;hope This’ll be&nbsp;a&nbsp;lesson to&nbsp;Yew!’</p><p>And I&nbsp;put the pictures of&nbsp;everyone stealing from the garden around the border. Also gave each person a&nbsp;funny fake name, ’Mr. Potato Head,’ ’Dill-a-Tante,’ ’Pothead,’ ’I Peony in&nbsp;My&nbsp;Pants,’ ’Frond-less,’ ’Root Boy,’ and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was funny and cutesy, like how can you be&nbsp;offended with dumb plant puns... My&nbsp;mom thought it&nbsp;was hilarious and wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;hang it&nbsp;up&nbsp;because she was sick of&nbsp;seeing stuff stolen. But I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;couple complains, one neighbor said&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;down because&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;his son, a&nbsp;minor, who did something dumb but was just trying to&nbsp;bring his sick girlfriend flowers. And that was disproportionate and rude to&nbsp;publicly shame him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dac/d41/80aa2751fdae699504884f3429.jpg><p>Too bad he got caught stealing.. teach your son to be honest, not a thief.. whatever his reasons, it was WRONG TO STEAL other people's property</p><p>“Another guy came to&nbsp;the house and returned a&nbsp;cutting his wife apparently took to&nbsp;propagate thinking it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;no&nbsp;big deal... But yeah, it&nbsp;damaged the plant because she cut like a&nbsp;quarter off. And he&nbsp;asked if&nbsp;we’d take down the sign because she was on&nbsp;the board of&nbsp;directors or&nbsp;something from the town and whatever. My&nbsp;mom had answered the door and told him to&nbsp;make like a&nbsp;bee and buzz off.</p><p>Anyway, I&nbsp;guess they both know each other and now both these families are annoyed. But am&nbsp;I in&nbsp;the wrong for making a&nbsp;petty sign about people stealing from my&nbsp;mom’s garden, hoping to&nbsp;get them to&nbsp;stop?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8da/216/4805a85548b390203233f6af57.jpg><p>good for you.. teach them a lesson. stealing is a crime.. whatever their reason.</p><p>Internet users supported the man, and it&nbsp;turned out that many gardeners were in&nbsp;his mother’s shoes:</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;tried growing yellow watermelons at&nbsp;the first house we&nbsp;owned. The plants were well within my&nbsp;backyard with several good-sized melons just about to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ripe enough to&nbsp;pick. Some kids (young teens) came through and used the melons for footballs.<br>I&nbsp;only grew roses there after that. My&nbsp;neighbor across the street loved my&nbsp;roses, so&nbsp;she kept a&nbsp;firm eye out for vandals for those plants.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Kittymamaxs3&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;planted 3&nbsp;pumpkin plants which&nbsp;I grew from seed. I&nbsp;started them indoors and when they were ready, I&nbsp;planted them in&nbsp;my&nbsp;allotment. All were growing so&nbsp;well and one even had 3&nbsp;nice sized pumpkins.<br>Then one day, someone dug up&nbsp;one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;pumpkin plant, so&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;huge hole where it&nbsp;should&nbsp;be. Plus they also took 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;the pumpkins. I&nbsp;gave up&nbsp;my&nbsp;allotment that season.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;swedesuz&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>As&nbsp;someone who once had her mature rose garden, including rare hybrid roses, butchered by&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman on&nbsp;my&nbsp;street who used them for her <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a>, those people absolutely deserve to&nbsp;be&nbsp;called out. I’ve been told, “It’s just plants” and “It’s just flowers.”<br>Well, fine. Let me&nbsp;come to&nbsp;your yard and steal your mailbox, windchimes, and patio furniture. It’s out in&nbsp;the yard, it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;fair game too, right? <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Outofworkflygirl&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90b/d48/097c2b5c03884b04119db8d1f2.jpg><ul><li>I&nbsp;like how it’s simultaneously not a&nbsp;big deal and a&nbsp;big deal to&nbsp;them. It’s not a&nbsp;big deal that&nbsp;I stole because it’s just plants, right? If&nbsp;you’re going to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;big deal about plants you’re just being petty. But also, it’s a&nbsp;big deal because you’re publicly shaming&nbsp;me.<br>So&nbsp;which is&nbsp;it? If&nbsp;it’s not a&nbsp;big deal that you stole plants it&nbsp;shouldn’t matter that someone called you out on&nbsp;it, right? <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;gerbil_george&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;don’t know what kind of&nbsp;woman the original poster’s mum&nbsp;is, but if&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;sick girlfriend (for example) and no&nbsp;money to&nbsp;buy flowers, why don’t you just ask if&nbsp;you can pick some? She might have even made a&nbsp;bouquet for you so&nbsp;you get the flowers she wants picked. These people will never know as&nbsp;they never asked. Most avid gardeners&nbsp;I know are itching to&nbsp;share their craft, so&nbsp;just ask nicely? <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Unknown author&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;agree with you. One time a&nbsp;young girl started picking my&nbsp;grandma’s roses. She went out and told her off. But after the girl said it&nbsp;was for her sick mum, my&nbsp;grandma gave her a&nbsp;bunch and told her to&nbsp;just ask next time. And gave her ones that had only just opened that day, so&nbsp;they’d last.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;trumpsaltereg0&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eaf/c6c/1995785b2eab331f98843e8f18.jpg><ul><li>They could have apologized and offered to&nbsp;give the cost of&nbsp;the plant or&nbsp;the cost of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bouquet of&nbsp;flowers at&nbsp;the florist. I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I would take down the photo if&nbsp;someone did that and actually showed remorse.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;zzplant8&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Especially the parents of&nbsp;the minor! Why haven’t they marched his butt down there to&nbsp;apologize and ask how he&nbsp;can make it&nbsp;right? They just expect they can guilt the original poster into giving them the easy way out. Great parents and role models! <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;bloseja&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Sadly, none of&nbsp;these people feel obligated to&nbsp;go&nbsp;apologize and ask nicely to&nbsp;have their photo taken down. Instead, they want to&nbsp;argue and act offended for being called out for their actions. I&nbsp;don’t know how we’ve gotten to&nbsp;this huge disconnect in&nbsp;society.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;jrevis05&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d7/ee2/5ae8f8550c81c489d748401e25.jpg><p>Many people create real beauty in&nbsp;their gardens by&nbsp;planting trees, bushes and flowers in&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain way to&nbsp;form colorful compositions.
