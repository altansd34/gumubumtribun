And some people cruelly play with others’ feelings until karma catches&nbsp;up. But when two people matched on&nbsp;the app are your acquaintances, with one being your friend, you may find yourself having to&nbsp;step&nbsp;in. That’s what our heroine did in&nbsp;the story below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/147/59c/7c5acc5d65ab5691ad8985e266.png><p>“I&nbsp;(28m) work with this woman Lydia (24f) who has a&nbsp;very annoying habit. She has a&nbsp;dating profile that she uses specifically to&nbsp;lure guys to&nbsp;buy her expensive dinners at&nbsp;restaurants she wants to&nbsp;try, and then ghosts them. Lydia brags about this all the time and is&nbsp;never interested in&nbsp;actually dating, but she’ll act like it&nbsp;to&nbsp;sell&nbsp;it.</p><p>I&nbsp;can’t stand this because it’s playing with people’s hearts, but Lydia thinks of&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;life hack to&nbsp;try food or&nbsp;drinks she otherwise couldn’t afford.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e4/fe4/0300de589cb564a7e6eec3b3e7.jpg><p>“My&nbsp;friend Daniel (32m) is&nbsp;also on&nbsp;dating sites, but for the right reasons. His late wife died a&nbsp;few years ago, and he’s just started jumping back into the dating scene. Daniel’s a&nbsp;very sweet guy, and&nbsp;I really want him to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;great lady for him.</p><p>A&nbsp;few days ago, he&nbsp;texted me&nbsp;asking if&nbsp;I knew Lydia. They matched and got to&nbsp;talking about work, which is&nbsp;how he&nbsp;found out we&nbsp;worked at&nbsp;the same place. I&nbsp;told him all about Lydia’s intentions with the restaurant thing and made it&nbsp;very clear to&nbsp;him that he&nbsp;would do&nbsp;his best to&nbsp;drop things off with her early&nbsp;on. Daniel said he’d probably still do&nbsp;the date but ask for separate checks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca7/ab2/dec5fc5f6aa527a58dfa5dba97.jpg><p>“Well, they went out this past weekend and on&nbsp;Monday Lydia came into work very upset. I&nbsp;asked her how her date with Daniel went, and she ripped into&nbsp;me, asking if&nbsp;I was the one who told him not to&nbsp;pay for her dinner.</p><p>Apparently, she had Daniel take her to&nbsp;a&nbsp;high-end steakhouse, and she ended up&nbsp;splurging. She got a&nbsp;drink, a&nbsp;full entrée with a&nbsp;side and dessert, and Daniel just ordered a&nbsp;sandwich and salad. Her bill alone came to&nbsp;$70&nbsp;something, and she was almost in&nbsp;tears at&nbsp;work as&nbsp;she didn’t expect to&nbsp;pay for it&nbsp;and now her car was low on&nbsp;gas.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05f/186/4a1b1d58c2b38de86056524db2.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;little upset too as&nbsp;she tried to&nbsp;use my&nbsp;friend as&nbsp;a&nbsp;literal meal ticket, but somehow she didn’t see it&nbsp;that way. Daniel told me&nbsp;later the date was going kind of&nbsp;well until he&nbsp;asked for separate checks, and then Lydia just got weirdly cold.</p><p>So&nbsp;now Lydia’s mad at&nbsp;me&nbsp;because&nbsp;I told someone about her little tactic, and it&nbsp;backfired on&nbsp;her. I&nbsp;don’t feel like&nbsp;I did anything wrong since it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;grieving friend&nbsp;I was protecting, but some other people we&nbsp;work with said&nbsp;I should have stayed out of&nbsp;it&nbsp;because it&nbsp;was none of&nbsp;my&nbsp;business.”</p><p><h2>People on&nbsp;the Internet shared their opinions about her situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f8/357/d1b6f95fbcaf58cb7ed46c7725.jpg><ul><li>“Her luck finally ran out. I&nbsp;question why Daniel still went ahead with the date after you clued him&nbsp;in, unless it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;show her&nbsp;up, in&nbsp;which case, fair play, it’s my&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;petty.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Prudent_Jello5691&nbsp;/ Reddit</a><ul><li>“He&nbsp;did because it’s been a&nbsp;while since he’s dated, and he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;get more comfortable with dating again after his wife died. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;talk him out of&nbsp;it&nbsp;altogether, but he&nbsp;said a&nbsp;first date be&nbsp;good for him irregardless.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>notyourcustodian&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul></li><li>“She did this to&nbsp;herself. You didn’t ‘cheat her’ out of&nbsp;anything. Her shameful ruse didn’t work. If&nbsp;she can’t afford her food, then she shouldn’t go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the restaurant.<br>You did what was right and protected your friend from a&nbsp;scammer. The people saying you did wrong are people with opinions not worth caring about.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>BulbasaurRanch&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“This is&nbsp;why&nbsp;I don’t do&nbsp;dinner dates for a&nbsp;first date. Just coffee or&nbsp;snacks and&nbsp;I establish that&nbsp;I will only be&nbsp;paying for myself during the planning stage.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mdthomas&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“You even told your friend to&nbsp;just cut ties, and THEY decided to&nbsp;still do&nbsp;the date. You did your part by&nbsp;warning them, and that’s all you could&nbsp;do. It&nbsp;was up&nbsp;to&nbsp;your friend to&nbsp;decide if&nbsp;they would pay for the dinner, and they chose not&nbsp;to. Eventually, Lydia had to&nbsp;know this scam was going to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rachaubrey&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/796/d5d/eb3c7b538bb442d9f076d3a888.jpg><ul><li>“Not all guys will agree to&nbsp;an&nbsp;expensive restaurant for a&nbsp;first date with someone they met online. I&nbsp;don’t have personal experience, but the people&nbsp;I know who do&nbsp;dating apps always have the first date be&nbsp;coffee or&nbsp;a&nbsp;drink, or&nbsp;another short-time activity, and if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;interest they move to&nbsp;dinner, a&nbsp;film, etc.<br>Even for those who go&nbsp;for dinner, not everyone will fall for her angling for a&nbsp;pricey date. I&nbsp;think most people will either opt out before the date or&nbsp;suggest a&nbsp;more modest date and get rejected, not go&nbsp;on&nbsp;the date and pull this stunt. The few that do&nbsp;agree are probably either desperate or&nbsp;well-off enough that they don’t think to&nbsp;question&nbsp;it.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Infinite_Slide_5921&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Men are not meal tickets. She’s hurting people by&nbsp;just using them for food.<br>You warned your friend who wants a&nbsp;true relationship after the death of&nbsp;his wife that she wasn’t what he&nbsp;was looking for. You protected him. You did nothing wrong. Lydia needs to&nbsp;pay for her own meals.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>yukidaviji&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Dates are supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;2&nbsp;people wanting to&nbsp;know each other and both parties should have the capability to&nbsp;pay for their own meal unless the other person insists on&nbsp;covering the entire bill. The fact that Lydia was mad at&nbsp;you after the date completely validates your decision to&nbsp;warn Daniel about&nbsp;it. Change your perspective and think about this instead. You helped Daniel save some money, and you helped Lydia realize that this is&nbsp;the consequences of&nbsp;her actions.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sundaeeeee&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;con known as&nbsp;‘Lonely Hearts Scam’ or&nbsp;just ‘Romance Scam’. You pretend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;romantically interested in&nbsp;someone, suck up&nbsp;as&nbsp;many gifts as&nbsp;you can, then ghost them. They often target widows/widowers because they’re emotionally vulnerable. Lydia will deny it&nbsp;up&nbsp;and down because she doesn’t see herself that way, but she’s literally a&nbsp;con artist taking advantage of&nbsp;people.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Abstruse&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Here’s <a href=#>another story</a> involving dating apps.
