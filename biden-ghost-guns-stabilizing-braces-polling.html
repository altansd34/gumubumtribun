A <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> conducted nine days after his inauguration found that just 40 percent of voters approved of his handling of the topic, ranking it last in a list of 14 issues. That share increased by 7 points in the latest poll, though his disapproval rating on the topic also ticked up by 4 points, from 35 percent to 39 percent.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The movement was largely driven by partisanship, with Democrats increasingly approving of his handling on the topic (from 65 percent to 78 percent) and Republicans increasingly disapproving (from 67 percent to 76 percent).</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The findings suggest that Biden’s early posture toward guns doesn’t pose a dire political threat ahead of next year’s midterm elections -- though the Democrats’ slim majorities in both chambers mean Republicans may not need to rely on a glaringly unforced error in order to ride traditional midterm dynamics back to power.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And while the recent shootings in Boulder and Atlanta have gun control advocates once again pressing for federal action, the polling <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>continues to show an uphill climb</a>. With cooperation from at least nine Senate Republicans necessary to advance legislation in a chamber where the filibuster remains intact, the latest poll finds 54 percent of GOP voters opposed to stricter gun measures, with 37 percent strongly opposed.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Given congressional Republicans’ refusal to support Democratic initiatives -- even ones that boast majority support among their own base, such as the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>COVID-19 relief package</a> -- the prospects of a grand bargain on gun ownership appear dead on arrival.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5e2pbHNZp6hp6OpeqjBzaxkrKyRl7attdmipaBlkqeupLHSZqeopJyeu6g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
