It was the second album she put out after winning the show in 2007. Her hit song “Battlefield” is still a favorite amongst popular radio stations, retailers, and longtime fans.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jordin-sparks-posts-tribute-to-battlefield-album-12-years-after-the-release>Jordin Sparks Posts Tribute to ‘Battlefield’ Album 12 Years After the Release</h2><p>Sparks was 19 at the time of the release of Battlefield on July 17, 2009. The album was released under Jive Records&nbsp;and&nbsp;19 Recordings. Songland’s Ryan Tedder worked as one of the producers of Battlefield. The 12-song album became a huge part of the pop music scene and has withstood the test of time. Sparks was touring with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonas Brothers</a> at the time of the album’s release.</p><p>Even though the title of the album is Battlefield, Sparks actually had a seamless experience recording it. It was a stark contrast from the recording experience behind her self-titled debut album. It was released just months after winning American Idol due to her popularity.</p><p>“With the first album, right after we got off the American Idol tour…they were like, ‘OK, they want your music NOW and you have to record it,'” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Sparks told&nbsp;Billboard.</a> “I literally think I recorded the album in a little over 20 days…This time I got to take my time, and if I recorded a song and didn’t like it, I was able to say, ‘OK, don’t like this one’ or let it grow with me a little bit.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CRj8-X9r0VP/</p></figure><p>Sparks celebrated Battlefield’s 12-year milestone with a sweet Instagram tribute. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Dancer</a> star posted the album cover and the credits for each track. Battlefield debuted at No. 7 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200&nbsp;chart. The title single landed at No. 10 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sparks-went-back-to-perform-the-song-on-the-stage-that-made-her-famous>Sparks Went Back to Perform the Song on the Stage That Made Her Famous</h2><p>Luke Edgemon, who competed on both American Idol and The Voice shared the special connection he has to the song in the comments section. He wrote that “Battlefield” was “the song they made us sing for idol auditions S9 and you can bet i was singin’ mine out too.” Before contestants sing in front of the judges, they sing in front of the producers. Sometimes the producers choose the songs.</p><p>Sparks went on to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">perform “Battlefield”</a> on American Idol in 2009. Tedder accompanied her on the piano. The “Battlefield” music video now has over 63 million views on YouTube. Other notable tracks on the album include “Don’t Let It Go to Your Head” and “Walking on Snow.” American Idol Season 7 runner-up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Archuleta </a>commented that “Walking on Snow” is his favorite song off the album.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/thumbnail_photoByArianaGrande_Youtube.jpeg alt="Ariana Grande, The Weeknd Vocals are “Off The Table” in Live Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>jordin sparks</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaipnaGeYsCxrdGkqmablaGyo77ArZysZWFnerqxwKuqZqeWYravssuunKesmZa5bq7AraulnZaesq2wjJqjm62dZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
