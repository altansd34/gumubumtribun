She recently reacted to her ex husband’s romance with TLC star Chilli.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cheryl Burke Wishes Her Ex Husband Well</h2><p>Earlier this year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lawrence</a> and Chilli confirmed on Instagram that they are officially a couple. This was after the two stars were photographed together vacationing in Hawaii last summer, giving rise to a possible romantic link.</p><p>During an episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Most Dramatic Podcast Ever With Chris Harrison</a>, Burke shared her thoughts regarding the matter. According to her, she does “wish him well.” She also noted that she isn’t shocked to know that Lawrence wants to have kids with the singer.</p><p>“He comes from a huge family and there were definitely conversations but I always had said, ‘As long as I had to shove my body in a dance costume, me thinking about being pregnant probably isn’t something I can talk about at the moment,'” she said.</p><p>The court finalized Burke and Matthew’s divorce in September 2022. Apparently, there have been discussions about freezing her eggs during their marriage, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS alum</a> revealed.</p><p>“I really truly hope he can actually have a kid with Chili. I think that’s amazing, I think he’s wanted that,” she said.</p><p>As per Lawrence, his romance with Chilli began as a friendship that ignited into something special over time. In his recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, he admitted that having kids is really their “game plan.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-honored-her-father-on-his-fifth-death-anniversary>She Honored Her Father on His Fifth Death Anniversary</h2><p>On March 10, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Burke</a> took the time to commemorate the death anniversary of her father. The professional dancer shared a series of lovely childhood snaps with her father and accompanied the same with an emotional message.</p><p>“Dad, it has been 5 whole years from today since I saw you last in person however, you will always & forever be in my heart and soul,” she wrote. “Love you beyond words and I hope you’re proud of the woman I’ve become and continue to be.”</p><p>Aside from this tribute, the former DWTS pro has been uploading short tutorials for followers who want to learn ballroom dancing for free.
