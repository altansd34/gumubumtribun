The episode featured two steals, including one three-way steal.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-season-25-knockouts-feature-three-way-steal>The Voice Season 25 Knockouts Feature Three-Way Steal</h2><p>For the Knockouts round, the coaches pair their artists up to deliver individual performances. They then decide which artist they want to keep on their team. Monday night’s show featured a three-way steal for Tae Lewis on Reba McEntire’s team.</p><p>Tae went up against Asher HaVon, who performed Toni Braxton’s “Unbreak My Heart.” For Tae’s performance, he sang “Nothin’ On You” by Cody Johnson. Both singers delivered incredible renditions of their respective songs.</p><p>McEntire chose Asher as the winner of the Knockout, saying she thinks he could win the entire competition. It’s not the end of the road for Tae, though. All of McEntire’s fellow coaches hit their buttons to steal him.</p><p>It was up to Tae to chose whose team he wanted to join. Ultimately, he decided that he wanted to keep things country by joining Dan + Shay’s team. Tae and Asher will both be moving on to the Playoffs.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHAT ARE ‘THE VOICE’ COACHES’ SALARIES FOR SEASON 25?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chance-the-rapper-steals-kyle-schuesler>Chance the Rapper Steals Kyle Schuesler</h2><p>Monday’s episode also featured a Knockout between Dan + Shay’s artists Anya True and Kyle Schuesler. Anya performed “Runaway” by Aurora, while Kyle took on “Say You Won’t Let Go” by James Arthur. Both singers impressed with their performances.</p><p>Dan + Shay chose Anya as the Knockout winner, meaning she’ll stay on their team for the Playoffs. But the show isn’t over for Kyle, since Chance the Rapper hit his button to steal the singer for his own team. Chance said he was “playing the long game” to get Kyle on his team.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are only so many steals to go around, so some of Monday’s artists had to go home. The eliminated contestants included Team Reba’s Ashley Bryant, Team Chance’s Dani Stacy, Frank Garcia on Team Dan + Shay, and Val T. Webb on Team Legend.</p><p>The second round of Knockouts will air next Monday night on NBC. After that, the remaining contestants will perform in the Playoffs for another chance to stay in the competition.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BGTJudges_Hosts_Jeff-Spicer_WireImage-220x147.jpg alt="‘Britain’s Got Talent’ Finally Announces Series 17 Premiere Date" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedKemKynnmJ%2FdnnKp6aco5%2BqwbR5wZ6eoqZdrLa1tIyaZK2gopqybsPAsmSsrJWWuXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
