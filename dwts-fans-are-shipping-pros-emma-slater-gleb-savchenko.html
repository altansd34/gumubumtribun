That includes Emma Slater, who posted a series of photos with Savchenko on Instagram earlier this week.</p><p>In the pictures, Savchenko and Slater pose by the pool in bathing suits and sunglasses, putting their arms around each other and smiling. As Slater captioned the post, “One of us is a Chippendale. The other one likes chips occasionally. It’s just a beautiful friendship.”</p><p>Fans in the comments had a lot to say about the pair, with one person writing, “Anyone else been kinda low key shipping Emma and Gleb?” Another wrote, “I did not recognize him with the glasses and thought oooh Emma got some arm candy.”</p><p>Someone else told the dancers to “get married already,” adding that they’re “so perfect together.” Yet another commenter wrote that they thought Slater’s post was “a hard launch” before they saw the word “friendship” in the caption.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘DWTS’ PRO EMMA SLATER EXPLAINS WHY IT’S NOT AWKWARD TO WORK WITH HER EX-HUSBAND</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-have-shipped-slater-with-several-men>Fans Have Shipped Slater with Several Men</h2><p>Savchenko is far from the first man fans have shipped with Slater since they learned of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her split from husband</a> and fellow DWTS pro Sasha Farber. People have speculated that Slater could be dating a few of her partners and co-stars.</p><p>In 2022, some fans hoped that Slater might get together with her celebrity partner Trevor Donovan. DWTS host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alfonso Ribeiro even commented</a> on the pair’s chemistry after they performed together. Then last year, rumors swirled <a href=#>that Slater could be dating</a> her Season 32 partner Mauricio Umansky. They denied the reports.</p><p>Then late last year, fans speculated that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there could be a romance</a> between Slater and fellow pro dancer Alan Bersten. Some even believed that the two might have gotten together while Slater was still with Farber.</p><p>Now fans are hoping for a Slater-Savchenko match-up. What do you think? Have fans gone overboard in their speculation about Slater’s love life? Would these two make a good couple?
