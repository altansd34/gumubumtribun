One day, he&nbsp;brought an&nbsp;enormous portion of&nbsp;fun to&nbsp;his owners, coming home after an&nbsp;unforgettable walk. And not only his owners but thousands of&nbsp;people were left in&nbsp;stitches after reading the post dedicated to&nbsp;Cotton candy’s shenanigans. After reading their story, we&nbsp;bet you’ll have a&nbsp;massive laugh too.</p><p><h2>Cotton Candy suddenly turned into a&nbsp;laugh-producing machine for his owners.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c1/57f/9d896156639aa3523084f1cc95.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;post on&nbsp;Reddit’s forum with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>95,000</a>&nbsp;upvotes, Cotton Candy the cat was <a href=#>captured</a> after seemingly receiving several <a href=#>kisses</a> from a&nbsp;secret admirer.</p><p>The cat lives with his owner Arivane, 54, in&nbsp;Florianópolis in&nbsp;southern Brazil, and their house has a&nbsp;big backyard with many <a href=#>trees</a> for cats to&nbsp;explore. The family also owns cats named Kimi and Xuxu. The oldest of&nbsp;the trio, Cotton Candy, loves to&nbsp;spend time outdoors playing in&nbsp;the <a href=#>backyard</a> and sleeping under bushes.</p><p>When Cotton Candy returned home sporting the vivid signs of&nbsp;some human attention, his owners were literally <a href=#>in&nbsp;stitches</a>.</p><p>“It&nbsp;all happened very suddenly,” Arivane <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview. “He&nbsp;appeared all kissed, and we&nbsp;didn’t know what had happened. We&nbsp;went to&nbsp;check and discovered a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the fence that surrounds our land.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a14/9ad/1c463859c3b49dc33e00bae890.jpg><p>Usually, the owners keep their 3&nbsp;cats <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>within</a> the confines of&nbsp;the family home with a&nbsp;fully screened backyard. But, after a&nbsp;quick <a href=#>investigation</a>, the family discovered that someone had found a&nbsp;way around&nbsp;it.</p><p>“Cotton Candy, or&nbsp;maybe his lover, had lifted the corner of&nbsp;the screen so&nbsp;they could touch and kiss each other,” said his owner. “He&nbsp;is&nbsp;really very sweet and <a href=# title=loving data-link=tag>loving</a>. He&nbsp;usually sleeps in&nbsp;our bed every day. So, we&nbsp;were very surprised by&nbsp;this new relationship, especially with the number of&nbsp;kisses he&nbsp;received from his beloved.”</p><p>Sharing the post on&nbsp;Reddit, Arivane wrote: “My&nbsp;cat showed up&nbsp;at&nbsp;my&nbsp;house like this today. Apparently, we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;cat lover on&nbsp;our street.”</p><p>The post now has more than 2,000&nbsp;comments, and the users continue laughing at&nbsp;their <a href=#>situation</a>. One user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “Cat’s just letting you know they’ve got options.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uw8eiq55lk5bBbsDUq6WsZaWleqLAjKGgrGWYpLqmecKorZ6qlZl6qrqMqaCno12htrG%2F06KapGWbnsC0sdJmpK6bmGLBsHnHoqpmp6ejsrO%2FjJqkrquVorKvwIxxaGpwaGt8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
