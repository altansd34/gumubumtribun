It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;that or&nbsp;pure chance, but the truth is&nbsp;that there are couples who meet and instantly see they will spend the rest of&nbsp;their lives together. That’s what happened to&nbsp;Steve Carell when he&nbsp;met Nancy. They’re now celebrating 27&nbsp;years of&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> brings you the story of&nbsp;Steve Carell and Nancy’s marriage, which is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;love, laughter, and many years of&nbsp;not letting go&nbsp;of&nbsp;each other’s hands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25e/8dc/acb77959e2a46778bccf00a86c.jpg><p>Steve Carell is&nbsp;a&nbsp;multifaceted actor who we&nbsp;have seen develop his skills in&nbsp;different characters, first in&nbsp;<a href=# title=comedy data-link=tag>comedy</a> and then in&nbsp;<a href=# title=drama data-link=tag>drama</a>. That, among other aspects, earned him the respect and affection not only of&nbsp;his fans but also of&nbsp;critics. But few people know that throughout his acting career, there has been one constant in&nbsp;his life: his wife, Nancy, whom he&nbsp;met before fame came knocking at&nbsp;his door and with whom he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;beautiful <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4c5/833/7f7ec55e7b810c22bc99466f1f.png><p>Their <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> long before Steve was a&nbsp;household name. They met while she was attending an&nbsp;improv class that he&nbsp;was teaching. She was his student, and he&nbsp;was attracted to&nbsp;her because, in&nbsp;his head, Nancy was everything he&nbsp;could have dreamed&nbsp;of. She was beautiful, bright and very funny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/212/6b8/a5ba735684947e15c8619bae32.jpg><p>face to face/Reporter / EastNews</p><p>But it&nbsp;took a&nbsp;while for the couple to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;more formal step from teacher and student to&nbsp;something more, as&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;misinterpretation. Steve <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thought</a> she hated him because she was so&nbsp;quiet when he&nbsp;was around. As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned out, Nancy was simply acting that way because she was nervous about being with him, so&nbsp;she felt she had to&nbsp;appear calm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/91e/520/89e83d5539bf136efe67565d32.jpg><p>The actor opened up&nbsp;about how long it&nbsp;took him to&nbsp;ask her out. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that he&nbsp;would tell her that if&nbsp;he&nbsp;were ever going to&nbsp;ask a&nbsp;girl out, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;someone exactly like her. And she would reply that if&nbsp;a&nbsp;man like him did that, she would think it&nbsp;was okay. However, things didn’t go&nbsp;any further than that. They went on&nbsp;like that for a&nbsp;long time until Steve finally asked her out, and she agreed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8b8/a65/fc6edb5a6eb940618079fa41a4.png><p>They got married in&nbsp;Massachusetts in&nbsp;1995. The actor said that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;hot day and the church had no&nbsp;air conditioning, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;was sweating a&nbsp;lot. However, when he&nbsp;turned around and saw Nancy walking down the aisle, everything instantly stopped: he&nbsp;stopped sweating and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thought</a>, “That person has my&nbsp;back, and I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;much more powerful now that she is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Steve loves his family and shows it&nbsp;by&nbsp;saying that his wife and children are his happy place. He&nbsp;refers to&nbsp;them as&nbsp;“his sense of&nbsp;home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/7ee/1cc/f3b11451c49f68b306be942498.jpeg><p>Nancy Carell is&nbsp;also very talented. She is&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and comedian and has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;writer for <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, <i>The Daily Show</i>, and <i>The Office</i>. Steve and Nancy aren’t only a&nbsp;power couple in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sentimental way. They also created a&nbsp;comedy series for TBS called <i>Angie Tribeca</i>, which ran for 4&nbsp;seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4da/235/d5944e5e06ab6585dadda70f20.jpg><p>They’ve worked together on&nbsp;set twice: first in&nbsp;<i>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</i>, where Nancy played a&nbsp;therapist, and in&nbsp;<i>The Office</i>. There she played the role of&nbsp;Michael’s girlfriend.</p><p>On&nbsp;Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey’s podcast, they talked about what it&nbsp;was like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the series. They all worked with Steve on&nbsp;<i>The Office</i>, and they said that once when Nancy worked alongside Steve, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noticed</a> something special: “You want to&nbsp;meet a&nbsp;man who loves you like Steve loves Nancy, because he’s charmed by&nbsp;her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b11/be2/a212075c7c903758be16542d63.jpg><p>face to face/REPORTER/Eastnews<span>, </span>Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>As&nbsp;the family grew, the dynamic changed a&nbsp;bit. Nancy retired from the sets to&nbsp;care for her baby, and Steve also experienced a&nbsp;career shift. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I’ll never forget the first audition after my&nbsp;daughter was born. I&nbsp;made it&nbsp;perfect because&nbsp;I didn’t care anymore. I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;home with my&nbsp;baby, and it&nbsp;changed my&nbsp;perspective on&nbsp;my&nbsp;career and the world, on&nbsp;who I&nbsp;was.”</p><p>While filming <i>The Office</i>, the actor made sure everyone finished early so&nbsp;they could have dinner as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. Steve <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Having children is&nbsp;by&nbsp;far the most important and the best thing we&nbsp;could have done.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d68/d24/b117755261b472936227f5ce60.jpg><p>Studies <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>have shown</a> that a&nbsp;shared sense of&nbsp;humor makes for a&nbsp;successful relationship, and we&nbsp;can see that’s true in&nbsp;Steve and Nancy’s case. They have been married for almost 30&nbsp;years and are a&nbsp;pretty stable couple. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “My&nbsp;wife is&nbsp;funnier than I&nbsp;am. As&nbsp;much as&nbsp;I don’t feel&nbsp;I share a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;humor with my&nbsp;family, I&nbsp;definitely share one with her. We&nbsp;find the same things funny.”</p><p>When asked about the secret to&nbsp;forming a&nbsp;strong marriage like theirs, Steve simply <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replied</a>, “There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;secret, I&nbsp;think you just get lucky.”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think is&nbsp;the secret to&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong relationship?
