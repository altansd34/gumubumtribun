Trump has made no secret his distain for members of the new media and,&nbsp;at one point,&nbsp;made <a href=#>attacking them a central&nbsp;message</a> of his campaign.</p><p>Less than one-fourth of Trump supporters (23 percent) want&nbsp;Cooper as a moderator, compared with 43 percent of Hillary Clinton’s supporters. Among supporters of the Democratic nominee, Cooper leads by a wide margin.</p><p>When asked, 37 percent of undecided voters said they want Cooper to moderate the debate.</p><p>Among the moderator choices of the entire electorate, Cooper was followed by Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who was supported&nbsp;by 25 percent of registered voters. The same network’s Sunday show host, Chris Wallace, was supported by 22 percent of voters.</p><p>Wallace is&nbsp;the choice of 34 percent of Republicans and 14 percent of Democrats. He also is leads&nbsp;among Trump supporters by a wide&nbsp;margin.</p><p>Despite a feud earlier in the campaign between Kelly and Trump, about one-third of Trump’s supporters&nbsp;(32 percent) back Kelly as a debate moderator, while only 18 percent of Clinton’s supporters want&nbsp;her.&nbsp;Kelly was chosen by 30 percent of Republicans and 18 percent of Democrats.</p><p>Only 7 percent of respondents selected the host of NBC’s Meet the Press,&nbsp;Chuck Todd. Among the other two hosts of a&nbsp;major network Sunday show, only 5 percent of voters selected ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and 4 percent selected CBS’s John Dickerson.</p><p>Ifill, who moderated the last three&nbsp;vice presidential debates, was&nbsp;only selected by 3 percent of voters. Schieffer, who has moderated debates in the past three presidential elections, was selected by 17 percent of voters.</p><p>The survey of 2,007 registered voters, conducted Aug. 24-26 has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.
