So, it's genuine to sincerely wonder about the omission when I saw the listed airports. "After my post, I got calls from major stakeholders who explained a few details to me. It's still same routes and these are all connecting flights, you enjoy the normal Air Peace flights from these locations to Lagos from whence you depart to London."<p class=align-left>Ifeanyi feels adequate communication would have prevented such a call out.</p>"So, it's simply a communication gap that would have been indicated in the banner, either by listing all the routes or dropping a line to explain, like "connect from your local airports or fly to London from your closest Airport with Air Peace.""So, I'm for Air Peace on this journey.
