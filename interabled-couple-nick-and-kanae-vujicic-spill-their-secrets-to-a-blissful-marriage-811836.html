Nick and Kanae Vujicic are a&nbsp;couple who may not have had a&nbsp;<a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> worth a&nbsp;fortune, but they’ve still found ways to&nbsp;keep the spark alive over the years. This interabled couple have become a&nbsp;real inspiration for those who believe in&nbsp;true <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. Today, they’re sharing the secrets of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a> with thousands of&nbsp;couples on&nbsp;the internet, and we&nbsp;believe you might find some helpful advice for yourself too.</p><p><h2>They help fight each other’s insecurities in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3da/015/cf0c935f47b670f131ee7ecf7a.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/434/77d/36e90155a19ea311f21bbaeb5d.jpg><p>Nick Vujicic was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> with tetra-amelia syndrome, which means he&nbsp;has no&nbsp;limbs. He’s come a&nbsp;long way to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;motivational speaker and a&nbsp;public figure who’s now recognized and loved all over the world. And he’s never tired of&nbsp;mentioning his wife’s role in&nbsp;everything that he&nbsp;has achieved so&nbsp;far.</p><p>His <a href=#>wife</a>, Kanae, helped him overcome the fear that he&nbsp;would never meet a&nbsp;woman who would sincerely <a href=#>love</a> him and who would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;devote her <a href=#>life</a> to&nbsp;him. In&nbsp;his book, Nick mentions how Kanae helped him fight his fears, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “The biggest test for&nbsp;us during our courting period was when&nbsp;I went through a&nbsp;personal financial crisis. Seeing Kanae’s commitment to&nbsp;stand by&nbsp;my&nbsp;side no&nbsp;matter what, was the most amazing discovery of&nbsp;how deep her love was for&nbsp;me. <strong>She looks at&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;I can tell she doesn’t see limbless Nick.</strong> ”</p><p><h2>There’s no&nbsp;coasting in&nbsp;their relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b8/3e3/d6f7615d29adf76915f69237fd.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/612/caa/f3d5485fcf8d48b7cb3f9b6fcb.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Coasting</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;moment in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship where a&nbsp;person has become so&nbsp;comfortable that they think it’s no&nbsp;longer necessary to&nbsp;put in&nbsp;any effort toward making the other person happy.</p><p>Nick and Kanae insist that, when you <a href=#>marry</a> someone, you don’t lower the stakes of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>relationship</a>, you raise them. Taking each other <a href=#>for granted</a> and putting the relationship on&nbsp;“cruise control” is&nbsp;definitely not for them.</p><p>One of&nbsp;their marriage tips <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suggests</a> that both spouses have to&nbsp;pay attention. If&nbsp;someone doesn’t, they can be&nbsp;sure the other spouse, or&nbsp;life itself, will at&nbsp;some point deliver a&nbsp;wake-up call.</p><p><h2>Spouses should be&nbsp;prepared for conflicts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/271/96c/4a3e645822ab4cacc7f0dfd9b1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9d/500/b0fa6e5b78ba2d067d9ebbd753.jpg><p>Nick and Kanae are sure that even though you and your spouse may be&nbsp;2&nbsp;peas in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pod, as&nbsp;compatible as&nbsp;peanut butter and jelly, sooner or&nbsp;later, your bliss may be&nbsp;disrupted. Different conflicts can occur, triggered by&nbsp;in-laws, family members, or&nbsp;even friends.</p><p>The source of&nbsp;the conflict may even be&nbsp;circumstances that you can’t fully control.</p><p>The couple advises that all spouses prepare for it&nbsp;and always keep this in&nbsp;mind. In&nbsp;their book, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>say</a>, “Being right isn’t nearly as&nbsp;important as&nbsp;being together. <strong>Sometimes you will be&nbsp;the windshield. Other times you will be&nbsp;the bug.</strong>”</p><p><h2>Remember why you married your spouse in&nbsp;the first place.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c6/c88/d1fb685acbb554f488011075e1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe3/e45/be45ba50cc9e3c72d31e543799.jpg><p>In&nbsp;his book, Nick <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “We&nbsp;choose the people we&nbsp;marry. When Kanae and&nbsp;I are at&nbsp;odds, I&nbsp;find it&nbsp;very helpful to&nbsp;look beyond the conflict at&nbsp;hand to&nbsp;the woman&nbsp;I fell in&nbsp;love with. Then I&nbsp;remind myself that&nbsp;I vowed to&nbsp;honor her and keep her in&nbsp;good times and bad. Our love is&nbsp;bigger than any disagreements we&nbsp;might have. Our relationship is&nbsp;more important to&nbsp;me&nbsp;than being right or&nbsp;winning an&nbsp;argument.”</p><p>Nick also tries to&nbsp;step back and think about the fact that Kanae has brought more joy into his life than he&nbsp;thought he’d ever know. That attitude, Nick says, helps him get through the challenging times as&nbsp;a&nbsp;husband.</p><p><h2>Spouses should never feel alone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/130/809/accc5f555781430f8f0858a772.jpg><p>Nick and Kanae highlight an&nbsp;important <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>truth</a>: there may be&nbsp;times when you <strong>just can’t figure out </strong>your spouse. You may not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;understand why there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;conflict, what you did wrong, or&nbsp;how to&nbsp;get beyond an&nbsp;issue that has put you at&nbsp;odds. In&nbsp;these moments, you may feel that you are all alone.</p><p>The spouses advise that, instead of&nbsp;going to&nbsp;your family and friends, you should think twice about if&nbsp;you really want to&nbsp;share your conflicts and frustration with them. They may feel it&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;pick sides, and that can become an&nbsp;issue down the road.</p><p>Instead, Nick and Kanae say it’s better to&nbsp;talk with your minister, a&nbsp;marriage counselor, a&nbsp;therapist, or&nbsp;some other impartial third party with experience in&nbsp;relationship issues. But the most important thing to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;mind&nbsp;is:<strong> the person who may need to&nbsp;change could be&nbsp;you.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLavwMSrmJuklZl6pLvUqaOeZZ6esKx5wKebZqORo66medWuoaKbmZh6tLzIpaNmrJiatrN50p6aq52kqHq1u4yaZJukmajAp8HLZqSaqqKerqixjHFoanBja3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
