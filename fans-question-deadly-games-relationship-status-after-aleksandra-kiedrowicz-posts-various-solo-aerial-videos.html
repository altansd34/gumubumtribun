Due to the influx of aerial videos on Kiedrowicz’s account, many are speculating her relationship status. Since Deadly Games is typically very active on social media, some fans think that Kiedrowicz and Alfredo Silva may be taking a break.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aleksandra-kiedrowicz-posts-aerialist-acts-alone>Aleksandra Kiedrowicz Posts Aerialist Acts Alone</h2><p>Kiedrowicz has been showing off her impressive moves while hanging from a hoop within her recent Instagram posts. These videos are captivating, since she makes it look both easy and graceful. Through each twist and turn, Kiedrowicz tells a story through her art.</p><p>Although it’s not out of the ordinary for Kiedrowicz to post aerial based content, some fans have taken the videos as a sign that Kiedrowicz and Silva’s relationship may be in trouble. Mostly, this rumor comes from the fact that it’s been quite some time since Kiedrowicz posted a video of herself performing knife-throwing tricks with Silva. In addition, the aerialist has reportedly been deleting comments from fans who as about Silva.</p><p>Now, eager fans are trying to get to the bottom of this, by leaving different comments. While some comment on her new direction, others are a bit sad about the possibility of her leaving Deadly Games. If Kiedrowicz and Silva have seperated, it just shows how complicated relationships can get when both parties are in the world of performing.</p><p>“You’re not doing the knife stuff anymore? I like what you’re doing now. It’s artsy and calming!” One person commented.</p><p>It is unclear what is really going on between Kiedrowicz and Silva. However, recent Instagram posts have certainly raised some questions about the status of their relationship. Only time will tell what the future holds for this talented couple.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are Aleksandra Kiedrowics and Alfredo Silva Still Together?</h2><p>Kiedrowicz and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Silva</a> have been the subject of much speculation in recent months, as fans have noticed that the couple has been posting fewer photos together on social media. In addition, Kiedrowicz has been seen practicing her aerialist routines alone, without Silva anywhere to be found.</p><p>Some fans have interpreted these changes as a sign that Kiedrowicz and Silva’s relationship may be in trouble. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim. The couple has not publicly announced that they have broken up, and they have continued to follow each other on social media. In addition, on Kiedrowicz’s most recent Instagram post, a fan commented about the couple being back together.</p><p>“Happy to see you and your hubby back together ❤️ hope you can both heal and grow. From a silent follower that enjoys watching your talent.” Another commented.</p><p>Many things are possible at the end of the day, it’s possible that Kiedrowicz and Silva are simply taking a break from their relationship, but on the flipside, it’s also possible they never separated in the first place. They may be busy with their respective careers, or they may be working through some personal issues.</p><p>In the meantime, fans should respect their privacy and avoid making assumptions about their relationship status. If Kiedrowicz and Silva do decide to break up, they will likely announce it on their own terms.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_OliviaRodrigo_Jeff-KravitzFilmMagic-220x147.jpeg alt="Olivia Rodrigo Drops “GUTS” Tracklist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xZqlrGWhqrK0wMiopWaclZaxrcWMoJimnaNiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedKtmK2to2Kup8DEq2SapJWgwKK6w6uYZqOZmrGzu9aimrNloKTAtb%2BMr5iroZ%2BqwG6%2FzqWmZpmVp7aiuIyvoJ2dn6h8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
