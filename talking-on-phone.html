This is because you can only rely on your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">listening skills</a>, and you can’t see the other person’s facial expressions or gestures. Because of this, it’s especially important to speak and communicate clearly on the phone. Additionally, talking on the phone often requires more formal language than everyday conversation does, as we are usually exchanging important information. Let’s learn how to talk on the phone in English with these four easy tips.</p><li><a href=#>Prepare yourself.&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href=#>Introduce yourself</a></li><li><a href=#>Use these key phrases</a></li><li><a href=#>Listen carefully</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Prepare-yourself>1. Prepare yourself</h2><p>Preparing before making a phone call can be extremely helpful for many people who are learning English. Write down why you’re making the phone call and what you want to get out of it. Perhaps you’re calling to ask a question or to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make an appointment</a>. We’re not telling you to write a script! You can’t predict what the other person will say. However, writing some bullet points will help you remember what you wanted to talk about.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Introduce-yourself>2. Introduce yourself</h2><p>Now we’re going to think about how to talk on the phone professionally. If you’re calling someone in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">business context</a>, introduce yourself with your name, the name of your company and the department if necessary. If you’ve spoken to the person before, remind them of that, especially if it’s a business call. This is something you can practice and prepare before the call to make sure you get off to a good start, which will help you feel more confident during the rest of the call.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hello, this is </strong>James Atkins <strong>from</strong> HelloNoodle. <strong>I work in</strong> the marketing department.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hi</strong> Mark, <strong>this is </strong>Sarah Coolidge<strong> from </strong>Express. <strong>We spoke</strong> last Wednesday.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Use-these-key-phrases>3. Use these key phrases</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Starting the call</h3><p>If you’re calling a reception area of a larger company, or if you’re using a general line, ask for the person or department you want to speak to immediately.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Hello, my name is Tina, I work at Johns Consulting.<strong> Could I speak to</strong> Mark, <strong>please?</strong></li><li><strong>I would like to speak to</strong> someone in the customer service department.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Answering a call</h3><p>When you are the person answering a call, it’s a good idea to state your name when you pick up in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">business context</a>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Good morning, this is Emma.&nbsp;</li><li>Hello, Peter speaking.</li><li>Good afternoon, marketing department.</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Saying why you’re calling</h3><p>When you reach the right person, state the reason for your call straight away and request any information you need.</p><ul><li><strong>I’m calling to </strong>make a reservation for tonight.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>I’m calling concerning</strong> a product I bought last week.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>I would like to ask about </strong>a holiday I saw on your website.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>I want to discuss</strong> the article you wrote last week. <strong>Is this a good time to talk?</strong></li><li><strong>I’m calling to find out</strong> what time the manager will arrive tomorrow.&nbsp;</li><li>The airline lost my luggage. <strong>Could you tell me</strong> when I might get it back?</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ending the call</h3><p>It can be awkward to know how to end a call, so here are some phrases to help you do that. Firstly, here are phrases if you called someone:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>I appreciate you talking to me today</strong>.</li><li><strong>Thank you for your time</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>I’m grateful for</strong> your help.</li></ul><p>And here are some phrases if someone called you:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>I appreciate your call</strong>.</li><li><strong>Thank you for calling</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>And you can always say, ‘Have a nice day!’ at the end of the call.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Listen-carefully>4. Listen carefully</h2><p>Practicing active <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">listening</a> is crucial during a phone call. There’s a huge temptation to start thinking about the next thing you need to say, but this is distracting and it means you’ll often miss information from the other person. The number one piece of advice is to not get distracted. Don’t scroll on your computer, don’t doodle, don’t think about lunch; just listen.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to practice active listening is to use verbal – like ‘um’ and ‘ah’. This helps the person talking know that you’re still listening. You can also ask questions or repeat things that the person says in order to check you’ve understood.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Did you say </strong>that the office closes at 5 pm?</li><li><strong>If I understood correctly,</strong> you would like to meet for lunch on Thursday, not Tuesday?</li><li><strong>I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. Could you repeat the last sentence?</strong></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are you ready to start talking on the phone in English?&nbsp;</h2><p>A little planning goes a long way so make sure to note down a couple of phrases and the goal of your phone call before you start. Practice introducing yourself and some of the phrases to say why you’re calling and to ask for what you want. Remember to listen carefully throughout the conversation, and make sure to say goodbye politely. It’s as easy as that!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
