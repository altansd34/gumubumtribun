Opinion is split on the song, although most people seem to agree that it’s better than “Woman’s World.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katy-perry-releases-new-single-lifetimes>Katy Perry Releases New Single ‘Lifetimes’</h2><p>“I’ll love you for / I’ll love you for life / Lifetimes,” Perry sings on the track, which has an energetic dance beat. The video finds Perry on vacation, having fun at the beach in a bikini and going clubbing. She even rides on the back of a motorcycle with a mystery man.</p><p>Perry said in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> that the song was inspired by her relationship with her daughter Daisy, explaining, “I ask her every night, ‘Will you find me in every lifetime?’ She says yes, and I feel found. You’ll find each other, over and over again, for lifetimes.”</p><p>“Lifetimes” is a follow-up to “Woman’s World,” which received <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">negative reactions</a> and even some backlash upon its release last month. People were especially critical of the accompanying music video, as they couldn’t figure out if it was supposed to be satirical.</p><p>Perry’s album 143 is set to be released on September 20. The singer teased the album’s tracklist in her new video, with the titles written on a billboard. They include “Gimme Gimme,” “I’m His, He’s Mine,” and “Artificial.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WAS KATY PERRY’S SONG ‘WOMAN’S WORLD’ INTENDED FOR THE ‘BARBIE’ SOUNDTRACK?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-do-fans-think-of-the-new-song>What Do Fans Think of the New Song?</h3><p>Opinions about Perry’s new song “Lifetimes” seem mixed. Comments on the YouTube video are pretty positive, with many users remarking that they prefer this track to “Woman’s World.” One <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan wrote</a> that it makes the previous song “seem like an unreleased demo.”</p><p>However, fans on the r/popheads Reddit group were more harsh. One person <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>commented</a> that “there’s 20 of this song around this time of year every year.” Someone else <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>described it</a> as “Great Value Kylie Minogue.”</p><p>What do you think? Will 143 be Perry’s comeback, or has she missed the mark with these first two singles? Will you be blasting “Lifetimes” for the rest of the summer?
