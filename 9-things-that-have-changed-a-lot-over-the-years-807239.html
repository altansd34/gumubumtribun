<span class=val><a href=./categories/celeb>Celeb</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>9 Things That Have Changed a Lot Over the Years</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>A&nbsp;few months ago, a&nbsp;misleading <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>picture</a> showing ancient Egyptian dentistry went viral. Shortly after, the image was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>debunked</a>, but it&nbsp;left a&nbsp;mark on&nbsp;us&nbsp;— so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;us to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mission. We&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;closer look at&nbsp;how some of&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;are familiar with looked decades, centuries, or&nbsp;even millennia ago.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;showcase some pictures that prove, once again, that necessity is&nbsp;the mother of&nbsp;invention.</p><p><h2>1. Dental bridges</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c1e/e5f/96c86f59c688d5a778058212ff.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>several</a> studies and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>findings</a>, ancient Egyptians used wires to&nbsp;replace missing teeth. The “donor teeth” and the adjoining teeth were drilled, and then, using a&nbsp;soft metal wire that wrapped through and around them, the empty space would be&nbsp;closed.</p><p>Today, this old practice developed into various procedures, one of&nbsp;them being “dental bridges.” This time around, the teeth next to&nbsp;the missing ones are drilled down to&nbsp;a&nbsp;cylindrical shape&nbsp;— <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>anchors</a>&nbsp;— and then the bridge, which can be&nbsp;made of&nbsp;porcelain, zirconium, or&nbsp;other materials, is&nbsp;attached with a&nbsp;specific kind of&nbsp;glue.</p><p><h2>2. Contact lenses</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e51/0c9/e893dd587db3632fb8a1d0ebf5.jpg><p>The idea of&nbsp;contact lenses is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;have been first introduced around the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1500s</a> by&nbsp;Leonardo DaVinci. This turned into a&nbsp;reality hundreds of&nbsp;years later, in&nbsp;1888, when ophthalmologist Dr. Gaston Fick created the first pair, which were blown from glass. The contacts measured between 18&nbsp;mm and 21&nbsp;mm in&nbsp;diameter.</p><p>Today, there are over <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>140</a> million contact-wearers worldwide, and thanks to&nbsp;the rising <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wave</a> of&nbsp;Lasik surgery, this number may decrease in&nbsp;the following years.</p><p><h2>3. Socks</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e9d/9ad/d94f185057844caf1d9480d154.jpg><p>The earliest known surviving pair of&nbsp;<a href=# title=socks data-link=tag>socks</a> date back to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>300s</a>. Initially, they were handmade, using matted animal hair or&nbsp;leather. The socks pictured above on&nbsp;the left were supposed to&nbsp;work with sandals, hence the split toes.</p><p>The invention of&nbsp;the knitting machine in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1559</a> made socks not only easier to&nbsp;produce, but also 6&nbsp;times faster to&nbsp;make. Up&nbsp;until 1938, when nylon was invented, silk, cotton, and wool were the main materials used.</p><p><h2>4. Roller skates</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c31/e62/910ac55ff8b0828ac2d8f9e924.jpg><p>The first recorded use of&nbsp;roller skates was in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1743</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;London stage performance. In&nbsp;the following century, multiple designs were patented. Finally, in&nbsp;the 1880s, the skates began to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mass-produced.</p><p>Between the ’50s and ’60s, roller-skating <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>carhops</a> became popular among restaurant-goers. Today, they look completely different, and while the basic idea remains the same, their popularity has only increased. In&nbsp;the past <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2</a>&nbsp;years, a&nbsp;worldwide shortage of&nbsp;skates has been reported.</p><p><h2>5. The toaster</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c1d/81c/043160562c85b650e6903af36b.jpg><p>We’ve been eating bread for well over <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>6,000</a> years and the first toaster, which dates around <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1750</a>, was as&nbsp;basic as&nbsp;can&nbsp;be; the sliced bread was put into a&nbsp;welded iron device and toasted above the fire. The first electrical toaster came about in&nbsp;the 1890s, and it&nbsp;only toasted bread on&nbsp;one side.</p><p>The “ejecting” toaster, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know it&nbsp;today, was created in&nbsp;1919 by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Charles</a> P. Strite, a&nbsp;Minneapolis resident who complained that the cafeteria at&nbsp;his work always served burned toast. By&nbsp;1926, the device found its way into restaurants and toasted bread perfectly, allowing people to&nbsp;adjust toasting levels to&nbsp;their own taste.</p><p><h2>6. The vacuum cleaner</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a6/2cf/4dd09e5e38ae74a5166ba95ad3.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that the world’s first <a href=# title="vacuum cleaner" data-link=tag>vacuum cleaner</a> was patented in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1860</a>; its creator, Daniel Hess, called the contraption a&nbsp;“carpet sweeper” and its <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>role</a> was <strong>“for the purpose of&nbsp;destroying dirt.”</strong> In&nbsp;the following <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>years</a>, the first petrol-powered vacuum was invented.</p><p>Today, while classic vacuum cleaners are still available, robot vacuums are becoming more <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>popular</a>. Now closely resembling a&nbsp;Frisbee disk, the “wandering cleaning circles” need just one click to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;work.</p><p><h2>7. Fans</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a5/0f4/03878e5f8d8ab232c4e044bc27.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Starting</a> out as&nbsp;lotus leaves and peacock feathers, the first electricity-powered fan was invented around 1882. A&nbsp;few years later, the first fans with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2</a>&nbsp;blades were produced. The first devices were not really safe because they didn’t have a&nbsp;cage around the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rotating</a> blades.</p><p>The concept of&nbsp;bladeless fans was introduced in&nbsp;1981. Contrary to&nbsp;popular belief, the device does feature blades, but they’re hidden in&nbsp;its base. In&nbsp;2009, designer James <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dyson</a> introduced the<strong> Air Multiplier</strong>, sporting a&nbsp;futuristic look.</p><p><h2>8. The lawn mower</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1de/282/4339de5a3c978888e25256dc60.jpg><p>Invented in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1830s</a>, the first machine used to&nbsp;cut grass was also known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;push mower because you literally needed to&nbsp;push it&nbsp;for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;work. It&nbsp;took more than <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>70</a>&nbsp;years until the first gasoline-powered one was available to&nbsp;buy.</p><p>100 years later, we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lawn-mower <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>robot</a> that doesn’t need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pushed or&nbsp;guided&nbsp;— it&nbsp;just needs to&nbsp;virtually map out your yard and can do&nbsp;the entire work for&nbsp;us.</p><p><h2>9. Baby car seats</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a6/86d/e79f835b1da0e95e9838f50044.jpg><p>The first manufactured car was on&nbsp;the market in&nbsp;the early 1900s. Not long after, in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1930s</a>, child baby seats were coming into production, but their main purpose was not safety; instead, they acted as&nbsp;booster seats, lifting the baby in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that their parents could see them mid-drive.</p><p>Child safety seats became widely available in&nbsp;the late <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1960s</a> and since then, they’ve come a&nbsp;long way. Today, they include foam padding, seat belt buckles, and attachment mechanisms. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;it, they feature an&nbsp;expiration date, between 6&nbsp;to&nbsp;10&nbsp;years.</p><p>What’s one vintage item that you use on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis? Have you ever seen an&nbsp;old-school baby car seat before?
