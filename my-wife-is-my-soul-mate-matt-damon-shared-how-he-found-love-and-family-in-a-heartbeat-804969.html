For celebrities, this can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;little more difficult because they have a&nbsp;very busy schedule and it’s hard for them to&nbsp;relate to&nbsp;someone who has a&nbsp;normal life. On&nbsp;the other hand, <a href=# title="Matt Damon" data-link=tag>Matt Damon</a> prioritized his feelings by&nbsp;falling in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> with Luciana Barroso and being part of&nbsp;her family, managing to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;balance between his work and the time he&nbsp;shares with his wife and daughters.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> will tell you how Matt Damon met his current wife, what impressions he&nbsp;had upon learning of&nbsp;her important work, and what he&nbsp;admires most about his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8a4/666/5f618e5373a85f3851c5483dfd.jpg><p>Matt Damon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> Luciana Barroso in&nbsp;Miami and, at&nbsp;the time, she was working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;waitress and raising her 4-year-old daughter, Alexia, on&nbsp;her own. Damon was shooting a&nbsp;movie and, after signing autographs and attending to&nbsp;fans, he&nbsp;approached Barroso and they started talking.</p><p>In&nbsp;her own words, Barroso recalls, “We&nbsp;definitely had a&nbsp;connection right away. It&nbsp;was so&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;each other that we&nbsp;felt comfortable. When you meet someone you have a&nbsp;connection with, it&nbsp;shows. And everything else, the part about him being a&nbsp;movie star, wasn’t really a&nbsp;factor. For&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was just Matt.”</p><p>When he&nbsp;asked her out later, she told him she had to&nbsp;watch her 4-year-old daughter, Alexia. And to&nbsp;the young woman’s surprise, the actor expressed his admiration by&nbsp;telling her, “I&nbsp;love that you’re a&nbsp;mom and that’s your priority,” thus showing her that this would be&nbsp;no&nbsp;impediment to&nbsp;starting a&nbsp;relationship. After getting married, they had 3&nbsp;other daughters, whom they raised to&nbsp;be&nbsp;empowered and compassionate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3bf/8fa/a0e06e532d90ebf5666a1153c1.jpg><p>Although they got married in&nbsp;2005, the 2&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;renew their vows a&nbsp;few years later. Damon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that they wanted to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;big celebration where their whole family would participate. In&nbsp;addition, he&nbsp;had the opportunity to&nbsp;ask his brother (who had already been married for 20&nbsp;years) what the secret of&nbsp;a&nbsp;good <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> was, to&nbsp;which he&nbsp;simply said, “I&nbsp;was very lucky.”</p><p>Because he&nbsp;didn’t marry an&nbsp;actress or&nbsp;another celebrity, Damon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believes</a> he&nbsp;can live a&nbsp;quiet life without exposing his family to&nbsp;the media. He&nbsp;also claims that dates with his wife tend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sporadic, but they always look to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;night together after picking up&nbsp;their daughters from school.</p><p>“We&nbsp;have a&nbsp;2-week rule,” Damon once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;don’t go&nbsp;out for more than 2&nbsp;weeks. I&nbsp;think you need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with the person you love as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible. My&nbsp;wife is&nbsp;my&nbsp;soul mate. I&nbsp;don’t like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;separated from her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae3/194/484e1d5b59938b53ef1a159464.jpg><p>As&nbsp;for his daughters, Damon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> he&nbsp;never expected to&nbsp;be&nbsp;surrounded by&nbsp;women and that every day is&nbsp;a&nbsp;new learning experience: “I’m learning so&nbsp;much, not the least of&nbsp;which is&nbsp;how much smarter girls are.”</p><p>He&nbsp;further added, “I&nbsp;operated under the assumption that&nbsp;us guys had a&nbsp;chance, but&nbsp;I realized when&nbsp;I was completely wrapped around my&nbsp;2-year-old’s finger, and she knew&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;they can do&nbsp;that to&nbsp;us at&nbsp;2&nbsp;years old, when they’re fully grown we&nbsp;really don’t stand a&nbsp;chance.”</p><p>Damon compared the feeling of&nbsp;parenthood to&nbsp;being the Grinch, but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good way: “When his heart grows five sizes, that’s what [becoming a&nbsp;father] felt like. It&nbsp;was like everything expanded in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that&nbsp;I didn’t know was possible. And it&nbsp;was instant.”</p><p>His love for his daughters is&nbsp;so&nbsp;strong that he&nbsp;even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tattooed</a> their names on&nbsp;his arm, distributing them according to&nbsp;their birth order: Alexia, Isabella, Gia, and Stella. He&nbsp;had previously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tattooed</a> the name “Lucy” in&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;his wife, Luciana Barroso, with whom he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;share his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/365/85f/2dec115892a611a3bcebc42d01.jpg><p>Matt Damon appreciates his wife’s personality, to&nbsp;the point of&nbsp;marrying her and raising the daughter she had from a&nbsp;previous marriage as&nbsp;his own. And with the 3&nbsp;they had over the years, they always stayed together, seeking to&nbsp;provide them with values that they will carry with them throughout their lives.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you appreciate about a&nbsp;family?
