He&nbsp;really is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sweet and loving husband, and&nbsp;I love him more than anything. My&nbsp;husband has always been a&nbsp;little out there. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;computer programmer and super smart, but also believes all sorts of&nbsp;things. Both real and conspiracy.</p><p>Lately, he&nbsp;has been very worried about the <a href=# title=environment data-link=tag>environment</a> and <a href=# title="global warming" data-link=tag>global warming</a>. About two months ago, he&nbsp;got real worried about <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a>. Yes, water. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;concerned about the quality of&nbsp;water. He&nbsp;put in&nbsp;a&nbsp;new filter system in&nbsp;our house, which&nbsp;I actually love because it&nbsp;tastes so&nbsp;much better.</p><p>But he&nbsp;is&nbsp;also concerned about how much water we&nbsp;use. Not because of&nbsp;money, but the environment. He&nbsp;created a&nbsp;new rule that we&nbsp;can only take 2&nbsp;showers a&nbsp;week. Now, I’m someone that likes to&nbsp;shower every day before bed. I&nbsp;just don’t like feeling dirty in&nbsp;bed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/62e/4ea/00a59b5ded88a2439ef5165e83.png><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>went on&nbsp;saying</a>:</p><p>“This has created the most conflict in&nbsp;our <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> in&nbsp;20&nbsp;years. <strong>He&nbsp;became obsessed with the amount of&nbsp;water we&nbsp;use. </strong>At&nbsp;first, I&nbsp;just ignored his rule, but he&nbsp;would shut off the hot water while&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;the shower. I&nbsp;started trying to&nbsp;use the shower at&nbsp;the gym, but it’s too much work to&nbsp;go&nbsp;every night with having kids. I&nbsp;honestly thought he&nbsp;would get over this within a&nbsp;month. But he&nbsp;is&nbsp;stuck on&nbsp;this still to&nbsp;this day.</p><p>Last night, <strong>I&nbsp;really needed a&nbsp;shower, but had ’hit my&nbsp;quota’ as&nbsp;he&nbsp;says. I&nbsp;said I’m showering and that he’d better not do&nbsp;anything. But about two minutes&nbsp;in, he&nbsp;turned off the hot water.</strong> I&nbsp;grabbed my&nbsp;towel and went down and started yelling. Telling him this is&nbsp;the dumbest thing he&nbsp;has ever done. I&nbsp;also told him I’m moving to&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents if&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn’t stop this.</p><p>Guys, I&nbsp;feel trapped now as&nbsp;I really love this man. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;everything to&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;I can’t take this anymore. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;going too far in&nbsp;threatening to&nbsp;move out?”</p><p><h2>Other Redditors weighed in&nbsp;with their advice and perspectives, leaving comments such&nbsp;as:</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/064/f02/5b404f55829b24677e1ef659b7.png><ul><li>You have a&nbsp;choice. You either continue to&nbsp;live this way with the understanding that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;water today... and could be&nbsp;food tomorrow. Or, you could get real with him and tell him his ideas are silly, and you refuse to&nbsp;subscribe to&nbsp;any more nonsense.<br>He&nbsp;sounds like a&nbsp;smart guy, but also a&nbsp;bit crazy. I&nbsp;mean, computers use more energy than anything.... maybe he&nbsp;should find a&nbsp;new line of&nbsp;work that doesn’t hurt the environment so&nbsp;much... See how silly it&nbsp;sounds? <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Artimities&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>This sounds exactly like a&nbsp;mental health episode, like he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;compulsion regarding saving water. I&nbsp;definitely think you should start up&nbsp;marriage counselling, and I&nbsp;do think moving out for a&nbsp;bit might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good idea. I&nbsp;don’t think you need to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;divorce at&nbsp;once, and&nbsp;I don’t think he’s being controlling for the sake of&nbsp;controlling.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;WhimsicalError&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Ecologist here. I&nbsp;work in&nbsp;some parts of&nbsp;the world that have been hit very hard by&nbsp;climate change and associated drought. What your husband is&nbsp;doing is&nbsp;not scientific, sanitary or&nbsp;particularly sane. People in&nbsp;places much drier than where you live&nbsp;— people who have practiced highly conscientious water use for decades&nbsp;— still practice better hygiene than your husband is&nbsp;allowing.<br>You and your husband can take short, water-conserving showers daily, save water and still be&nbsp;clean and comfortable. The amount of&nbsp;water saved beyond that, by&nbsp;not showering at&nbsp;all, is&nbsp;beyond trivial, and the cost to&nbsp;your mental health is&nbsp;absolutely not worth&nbsp;it.<br>Anyway, this isn’t about water conservation, because your husband is&nbsp;having no&nbsp;impact whatsoever on&nbsp;water issues. This about obsessive and controlling behavior. You love him, and you won’t leave him, but whether you move out or&nbsp;not, you should insist he&nbsp;sees a&nbsp;therapist right away.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;GDswamp&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a5b/ca9/bdb4b75eb2b2c8764110844779.png><ul><li>This is&nbsp;insanely controlling, and&nbsp;I hate when people do&nbsp;things like this. The amount of&nbsp;water used in&nbsp;a&nbsp;household is&nbsp;incomparable to&nbsp;the amount used by&nbsp;corporations that are actually damaging the environment.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;AcanthisittaTiny710&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>In&nbsp;my&nbsp;book, turning off the hot water while you’re in&nbsp;the shower is&nbsp;crossing the border. Stating your preference and making a&nbsp;request is&nbsp;understandable, but taking away someone else’s bodily autonomy is&nbsp;violence. Turning off the hot water may be&nbsp;passive-aggressive, but he’s still making the choice for his wife about whether she can clean herself or&nbsp;not.<br>I&nbsp;wouldn’t up&nbsp;and divorce him immediately, but this situation definitely warrants counseling to&nbsp;learn why he&nbsp;feels he&nbsp;has this right to&nbsp;control others and how to&nbsp;stop&nbsp;it, and you’re doing the right thing to&nbsp;stay somewhere else until he&nbsp;gets over whatever is&nbsp;going on&nbsp;with him. You could also benefit from therapy to&nbsp;find out why you love this man with all your heart when it’s clearly not reciprocated in&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy way with respect for your boundaries. This goes beyond a&nbsp;personality quirk or&nbsp;oddball personal interest.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;i-split-infinitives&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Tech also takes a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;water to&nbsp;produce and use, funny enough. How does he&nbsp;think servers and data centers are cooled? As&nbsp;a&nbsp;programmer, he&nbsp;probably uses some amount of&nbsp;AI, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge water draw, to&nbsp;the point that environmentalists are becoming very concerned.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;TheDreamingMyriad&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;different scenario, a&nbsp;woman shared her dilemma where her husband, who exhibits controlling behavior, secretly tried to&nbsp;get her pregnant despite her decision to&nbsp;remain childfree.
