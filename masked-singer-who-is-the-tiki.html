And seeing how much star power and talent we got in Group A, we’ve got high hopes. One of the new masks taking the stage will be the Tiki. If their costume matches their personality, they’ll be a ton of fun!</strong></p><p>But who is the celebrity under the Tiki mask? And what clues have we gotten so far? Let’s go through them all and make our prediction.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4yJ72Y_w1A</p>The Tiki performs “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” on The Masked Singer Elton John Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 10</h2><p>The Tiki’s clues started looking like VH1’s Behind the Music, with Tiki explaining that for as long as he can remember, he always wanted to be a rockstar. We see an alarm clock blinking “SNOOZE” while he talked. Tiki got to “sell millions of records, travel the world, and party with some of music’s biggest names.” He’s walking through a studio and we see a globe, a set of records on the wall, and a skull.</p><p>But the Tiki had a loose mouth and got himself in a lot of trouble. The Pineapple, his friend and Tommy Chong from a previous season, explained that he rubbed some people the wrong way. After all the highs, he feared his career would be over. We see him laying on a couch passed out, while a monkey in a party hat approaches the camera. Instead, he cleaned up his act and stepped out on his own!</p><p>Once his performance ended, we got one last clue about his identity. It was an audio clue, the song “I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues,” which the Tiki explained by saying, “If you’re ever feeling bluesy, you can come to me for a good laugh!”</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO’S PERFORMING ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 10 PREMIERE?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Tiki</h2><p>Jenny thought the Tiki could be an amazing comedian or actor who can sing, like John Stamos. Nicole predicted it’s a singer, someone like David Lee Roth. Robin guessed it’s Robert Plant from Led Zeppelin. Fans online started guessing as soon as this mask was announced. They think the Tiki could be Jack Black, Vince Neil, Kevin Cronin, Sebastian Bach from Skid Row, or, in agreement with Nicole, David Lee Roth. I love the idea of this being a rock legend and icon, which could also explain the emotional reaction from judges teased in the preview.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Tiki on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>All the clues and that voice point to one rock legend! And that is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sebastian-bach>Sebastian Bach!</h3><p>From Skid Row to The Masked Singer stage, Sebastian Bach is a contender to win it all this season. Here’s how the clues line up! The judges mention he’s tall and Sebastian is 6’3″. The VH1/Making the Music references also make sense because Sebastian Bach hosted a show on VH1 and starred in reality shows on the channel. He mentioned selling millions of records and Sebastian has sold over 20 million, traveling the globe which he’s definitely done, and partying with the biggest names in music, and Sebastian has toured and partied with Guns N Roses and Metallica.</p><p>His mentions of his mouth getting him into trouble could be referring to him getting kicked out of Skid Row amid many controversies. Since then, he’s released multiple solo albums and gone sober. The monkey could be pointing to his song “Monkey Business.” Finally, he mentioned comedy a few times in his clues and on-stage banter. Sebastian Bach not only made an appearance in an episode of Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park with the Pineapple, Tommy Chong, but also appeared in multiple other episodes of the show as well as in Gilmore Girls.</p><p>Did we do enough to convince you that the Tiki is Sebastian Bach?
