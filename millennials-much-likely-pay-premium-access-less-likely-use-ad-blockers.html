Poll respondents under the age of 30 were about 20 percentage points more likely than adults as a whole to say they purchased access to websites for each of those reasons.</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-62029"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/paywebsite.png alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Pay-for-access or ad-free websites are poised to become increasingly valuable sources of revenue for publishers. Google Inc. last week announced <a href=#>changes</a>&nbsp;to its Chrome browser, saying that next year it would only allow advertisements that comply with the “<a href=#>Better Ads Standards</a>.” That move could prohibit flashing ads and those that automatically play sounds.</p><p>While young adults were more likely to say they’d pay for site access, they were a little less likely than adults overall to say they use ad-blocking software. Forty-three percent of adults said they use ad-blockers, while 37 percent of adults younger than 30 reported using that kind of software. Usage among older adults was, on average, 8 points higher.</p><p>The poll was conducted May 23-25 among a sample of 2,128 U.S. adults. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
