The entertainer made it to the semifinals after impressing the judges and viewers over the weeks. His charm and charisma added to his act, while showcasing his unbelievable talent. His acts were jaw dropping and sometimes dangerous.</strong></p><p>The performer was a season vet before walking onto one of the biggest stages of the world. Colin was born and raised in Scotland. Some would say he was a young genius. At 15 years old Colin was accepted into University to study forensic investigation. He had a passion for criminal profiling, leading some fans to consider him a real life Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>Before America’s Got Talent Colin was already a world renowned mentalist. He has been all over the world, from performing Off Broadway in New York and in London’s West End. Colin has showcased his skills as a headlining act in Caesar Palace in Las Vegas and Magic Castle in Hollywood. The entertainer made history by being the first individual to correctly predict the exact Tweets of other people, days in advance. Colin predicted Frankie Boyle, Ellie Goulding, as well as Ricky Gervais’s posts.</p><p>Fans of America’s Got Talent will remember Colin for how much he engaged with the audience and how he was able to fool the judges. One of his more memorable acts was where he investigated the “murder” of judge Simon Cowell.</p><p>Colin had Mel B point out a random audience member to come up on stage and write a reason to kill Cowell on a piece of paper. He then asked the audience to think of naughty memories in detail. Colin identified one such member and correctly guessed that member’s naughty memory. The act sent him to the semifinals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mentalist-colin-cloud-on-america-s-got-talent>Mentalist Colin Cloud on ‘America’s Got Talent’</h2><p>Although Colin did not go on to win the championship during Season 12 of America’s Got Talent, he continued to thrive in his career.
