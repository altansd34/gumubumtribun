Though the American Idol judge has never explicitly revealed her due date, it has been almost nine months since she first announced her baby news so she will definitely be<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> ready to give birth</a> within the next few weeks.</strong> <strong>Check out some photos of the beach day down below.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-will-be-expecting-their-baby-any-day-now>Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Will Be Expecting Their Baby Any Day Now</h2><p>Katy wore a purple one-piece bathing suit as she walked through the water. Fiancé Orlando was close by on a boogie board opting for a sun hat and some black surfing gear. But truthfully, all eyes were on Katy as she nears her due date, and the happy parents along with the whole rest of the world cannot wait to meet their baby girl. This is the pair’s first child together. Orlando shares 9-year-old son Flynn with model Miranda Kerr.</p><p>During an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>“Hits Radio Breakfast” </a>last week, Katy said, “I am waddling like a duck” as her pregnant belly has continued to grow. But she still looks stunning as she made this rare public outing. She first had her bump on full display during this season of American Idol after announcing the pregnancy news to the whole world. Another thing she has experienced during pregnancy is her different breathing pattern. “I’m breathing heavily, I’m a full-on mouth-breather. And, um yeah, it’s loud and obnoxious. And — oh my God — I just eat so much flavored ice! It’s like put all the ice in my mouth, right now!” she said.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>WHEN IS KATY PERRY’S BABY DUE?</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katy-got-up-close-and-personal-about-how-her-body-is-changing>Katy Got Up Close And Personal About How Her Body Is Changing</h3><p>Katy recently showed her fans a closer look at her belly button and how it has changed during the pregnancy. When asked on the radio show about what she looks forward to most about motherhood, she jokingly said “my belly button going back.” She went more in-depth saying that her belly button is “definitely one of those things when you’re not pregnant that if you observe other pregnant women you’re just like, I just hope my belly button stays where it’s at and it doesn’t pop, I really hope I don’t look like that.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Who else would show off their belly button like this other than the American Idol judge?</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>WHO’S THE TARGET OF KATY PERRY’S ENCRYPTED THREAT TO YOU HOES’?</a></strong></p><p>Katy also told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> that quarantine has helped her find a “necessary balance” in her life to prepare her for motherhood. “I have found a lot of ways to be incredibly grateful and to bond with my family on a deeper level than I ever have,” she continued about her pregnancy. “Rather than just a vacation or a holiday, there’s a new foundation that is being laid within families, between partners.&nbsp; I just think people that are quarantined together will never forget this time.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Naya-Rivera-Lake-Piru-Glee-Dead.jpeg alt="Tributes Pour In As Body Found At Lake Piru Is Confirmed To Be ‘Glee’ Star Naya Rivera" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>katy perry</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>katy perry baby</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqrsmWgmr%2BzxdJmmZ6knK56o8HMqWSiq12dwqixjKKlZqaVrHqxvsSgpZqmpGKvqrfIp6BmmpWWsKl5z6GmraejYsSqwMdmpqukkaOxsHnBpaaopV2ltbDAzqxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
