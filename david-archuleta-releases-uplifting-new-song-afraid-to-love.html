Archuleta has been open about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his years-long struggle</a> coming to terms with his sexuality.</p><p>“I’ve been learning to accept myself as I am and to not be afraid anymore of what people think of me,” Archuleta <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said of his journey</a>. “Letting go of any hate and declaring to everyone I’m not going to fear what people think of me for loving whoever I love.”</p><p>The new video, directed by Brad Hammer, also features clips of Archuleta watching old videos of himself on TV, including his American Idol audition. The singer finished in second place on the talent show when he was just 17 years old.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AMERICAN IDOL’ STARS GRACE KINSTLER, DAVID ARCHULETA TEASE NEW SONG</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-archuleta-celebrates-15-years-of-crush>Archuleta Celebrates 15 Years of ‘Crush’</h2><p>Archuleta recently celebrated the 15th anniversary of his debut single “Crush,” which was released just months after his time on American Idol in 2008. The singer revealed how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his relationship with the song</a> has changed since he came out.</p><p>“It was very much from an appreciation of the song writing, the melody, the pop song structure of the song that made me so excited to sing it rather than, ‘This is what I go through’. Because I didn’t go through it,” Archuleta said of his initial feelings about the song.</p><p>However, he added that he has now “had that experience.” He even went as far as to tweak the song’s lyrics during a recent live performance, changing the word “girl” to “boy.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_NoahThompson_Momodu-Mansaray_Getty-Images.png alt="Noah Thompson Debuts Music Video for Song ‘One Day Tonight’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>David Archuleta</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qtopxdlr%2BktNSlnK2ZXaeyrbHArJysZaWluaqy06KloGWemsRuv86nnmaZlqeuqrCMraZmpJ%2BrsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
