She was super excited and wanted to&nbsp;start planning right away.» The loving couple appeared destined for a&nbsp;blissful future, yet the woman’s true personality emerged, leaving the man bewildered and prompting him to&nbsp;seek assistance from internet users.</p><p>At&nbsp;45&nbsp;years old, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>protagonist</a> of&nbsp;this story is&nbsp;a&nbsp;devoted father to&nbsp;an&nbsp;11-year-old daughter from his previous marriage, sharing custody with his ex-wife. However, he&nbsp;found love anew and embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey to&nbsp;nurture a&nbsp;fresh relationship. Right from the start, <strong>his girlfriend formed a&nbsp;strong bond with his daughter, </strong>bringing immense joy to&nbsp;the man’s heart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/754/5b6/3a448e5dae90b7891c8d1e5d2a.jpg><p>Following the proposal, the fiancée eagerly began scouting venues and assembling her bridal party by&nbsp;inviting her friends to&nbsp;be&nbsp;bridesmaids. However, shortly thereafter, an&nbsp;unforeseen event disrupted their plans.</p><p>The man wrote, "<strong>She then told me&nbsp;she wanted her niece to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;flower girl.</strong> Which I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;problem with, but&nbsp;I said&nbsp;I also wanted my&nbsp;daughter to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;flower girl. My&nbsp;fiancée looked at&nbsp;my&nbsp;funny and then declared, ’’Well, I&nbsp;don’t think your daughter would <strong>fit the part.</strong>’’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e1b/6cf/5d13955de3adf69781915eed98.jpg><p>Shocked by&nbsp;the unexpected turn of&nbsp;events, the man penned his thoughts, «I&nbsp;got angry and told her that my&nbsp;daughter would be&nbsp;at&nbsp;our wedding. My&nbsp;fiancée started to&nbsp;become upset and said that the girls in&nbsp;the wedding were up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her and my&nbsp;daughter wouldn’t be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them. I&nbsp;told her that if&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter wasn’t in&nbsp;the wedding then there might not be&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding. I&nbsp;stormed out and took my&nbsp;daughter to&nbsp;get ice cream.</p><p>My&nbsp;daughter knows we&nbsp;are getting married and told me&nbsp;she thinks she will look pretty in&nbsp;whatever dress my&nbsp;fiancée decides she should wear. This broke my&nbsp;heart.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c57/c4d/f3e9325e4488401144b2080711.jpg><p>Later, the man went back home to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;his fiancée and to&nbsp;ask her why she didn’t want his daughter at&nbsp;the wedding, but the answer he&nbsp;got full-on shocked him.</p><p>She quietly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replied</a>,<strong> ’’I was hoping that after the wedding you could become a&nbsp;holiday visit only dad.’’</strong> She then added, ’’I didn’t want her in&nbsp;the wedding so&nbsp;she wouldn’t be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the photos around the house since she wasn’t going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around much.’’</p><p>After hearing this, the man says that he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;keep his cool, then he&nbsp;calmly took his fiancée’s hand and<strong> pulled his engagement ring off.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8a6/d5e/21ac4d52c59abc8187060d09e5.png><p>You did right dad. Now please don't ever speak to her again. Your daughter deserves a step mom that wants to grow with her. This story absolutely broke my heart, and I just want to say thank you for being a great dad and putting your baby first, I wish there were more dads like you. Also, your 11yo is far more wiser than that woman who almost trapped you.</p><p>Faced with a&nbsp;distressing predicament, the man turned to&nbsp;internet users for guidance and counsel. «So, did&nbsp;I take it&nbsp;too far saying&nbsp;I will cancel? Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;overreacting or&nbsp;just being a&nbsp;good dad?» The majority of&nbsp;commenters sided with the man. By&nbsp;the way, the first comment was liked by&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;people.</p><ul><li>Absolutely, never put a&nbsp;new partner over your own child. Your child is&nbsp;your first priority and any new partner should fully embrace the fact that your child is&nbsp;in&nbsp;your life and theirs. <a href=# title="Red flags" data-link=tag>Red flags</a> galore if&nbsp;they want to&nbsp;exclude from now. OP, think long and hard about how your new partner currently treats your child and how you see this working in&nbsp;the future if&nbsp;the new partner were to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;your life.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Ill_Mood_8514&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>As&nbsp;the stepchild who got excluded, do&nbsp;not do&nbsp;that to&nbsp;your daughter! You sit that woman down and tell her you’re a&nbsp;package deal or&nbsp;your relationship with your daughter will suffer from&nbsp;it.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;WonderfulRip6246&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Below are several additional remarks:</p><ul><li>Cancel the whole wedding and re-evaluate your relationship. Your daughter is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your life. If&nbsp;your ’fiancée’ doesn’t accept&nbsp;it, she can’t be&nbsp;your fiancée or&nbsp;wife.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Couette-Couette&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;got married to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband when his boys were 7&nbsp;and 9. Hubby and&nbsp;I said vows and then the boys joined&nbsp;us for family vows. All 4&nbsp;of&nbsp;us lit the unity candle. I&nbsp;married a&nbsp;family, not a&nbsp;man.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Chance_Ad_8255&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big red flag. If&nbsp;she doesn’t want to&nbsp;include her stepdaughter in&nbsp;her wedding, then don’t expect she will include your daughter in&nbsp;her life.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;10×10Hag&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>What actions do&nbsp;you believe would have been appropriate for the groom in&nbsp;this scenario? Some people may not consistently enjoy spending time with their stepchildren, similar to&nbsp;the situation in&nbsp;<a href=#>this story which sparked a&nbsp;big debate.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuuMSfq2alqWKzqq3NnJyeZZKasKLB0p5kqJ5dnbKzecinqq6kpJ67qHnRnqiunaOperOxxpqpnaGenHquxYydmK6fmKmys3mXam5xbmBk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
