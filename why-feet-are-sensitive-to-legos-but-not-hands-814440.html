They have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;this sensitive to&nbsp;keep you balanced and not flip over. All those nerves constantly send information to&nbsp;your brain.</p><p>It&nbsp;uses more power to&nbsp;process it&nbsp;than on&nbsp;the data from your entire torso. So, when anything happens to&nbsp;your feet, like extra pressure, change of&nbsp;temperature or&nbsp;stepping on&nbsp;something sharp like Legos&nbsp;— it&nbsp;really hurts a&nbsp;lot!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/175/5a1/d4c1735b8f89ad4351c829fe2b.png><p>Lego bricks are made of&nbsp;three plastic polymer components. It&nbsp;makes them super resistant and strong. It&nbsp;would take a&nbsp;big horse or&nbsp;a&nbsp;piano to&nbsp;compress a&nbsp;Lego. When you step on&nbsp;it&nbsp;with all your weight focused in&nbsp;one point on&nbsp;a&nbsp;solid surface, all of&nbsp;its super strength strikes back at&nbsp;you. It&nbsp;gets right into that huge bundle of&nbsp;nerves making things even worse.</p><p>Things are slightly better on&nbsp;a&nbsp;soft rug, but that doesn’t solve the problem. Lego felt so&nbsp;guilty of&nbsp;all the pain it&nbsp;causes they even created anti-LEGO slippers. The slippers with an&nbsp;open back fit both right and left feet. They have so&nbsp;much padding on&nbsp;the insoles you could step on&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge brick and feel nothing. The slippers were a&nbsp;limited edition of&nbsp;1,500&nbsp;units. Random Lego fans received them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift from the company.</p><p>Stubbing your toe hurts so&nbsp;much because you’re exposing its tiny surface to&nbsp;the force of&nbsp;a&nbsp;karate punch. It’s packed with nerve endings that aren’t protected by&nbsp;much fat padding. The pain signal instantly fires into your brain. This used to&nbsp;save people long before antibiotics were invented. People were more careful about where they step to&nbsp;avoid all that pain. This saved them from lots of&nbsp;trouble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d25/aa6/3618845102a0066fb0c12f725f.png><p>Researchers are still not 100% sure why some people are more ticklish than others. Some think it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;genetic, or&nbsp;has to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with how sensitive your skin&nbsp;is. You’re normally most ticklish in&nbsp;the most vulnerable places, like the abdomen or&nbsp;throat. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural reflex to&nbsp;push away the intruder. Most people become less ticklish as&nbsp;they get older and when they’re sad or&nbsp;angry.</p><p>You see someone yawn and yawn back at&nbsp;them for the same reasons you imitate the words and actions of&nbsp;others. It’s a&nbsp;primitive unbeatable reflex of&nbsp;people and some animals like chimpanzees and dogs. Research has shown contagious yawning is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;<a href=# title=empathy data-link=tag>empathy</a> and bonding. The more you try to&nbsp;stop yourself from yawning, the more you want to&nbsp;yawn.</p><p>You feel so&nbsp;good after a&nbsp;sneeze because it’s a&nbsp;massive tension release. When that happens, your body releases the so-called feel-good chemical&nbsp;— endorphin. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things, from plucking your eyebrows to&nbsp;working out and staying in&nbsp;the bright sun can make you sneeze. You can’t sneeze in&nbsp;your sleep because your sneezing nerves are also sleeping.</p><p>Sneezing is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;your body because it&nbsp;clears the nose of&nbsp;<a href=# title=bacteria data-link=tag>bacteria</a> and irritating stuff and also keeps the mucus level in&nbsp;balance. Sometimes one sneeze isn’t enough to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all that, or&nbsp;it&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too powerful for you to&nbsp;handle. That’s why sometimes you sneeze a&nbsp;few times one after another to&nbsp;make sure it&nbsp;worked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c43/511/89b9095af4a4f95866af61fdfe.png><p>You’ve inherited goosebumps from your animal ancestors. Their hairs stand up&nbsp;when they’re cold or&nbsp;scared. As&nbsp;the hair coat rises, it&nbsp;becomes thicker and keeps them warm or&nbsp;makes them look bigger. You have way less hair than animals, so&nbsp;this feature is&nbsp;mostly useless. Still, you get goosebumps in&nbsp;the same situations plus when you’re emotional. The tiny muscles under your skin contract, making the hairs stand up&nbsp;and the areas around them protrude.</p><p>You feel super tired after a&nbsp;long time in&nbsp;the sun because it&nbsp;makes you lose water faster and your body temperature rise. Your body and your <a href=# title=heart data-link=tag>heart</a> have to&nbsp;work harder to&nbsp;keep the temperature normal and deliver all the vital fluids to&nbsp;your organs. Staying in&nbsp;the sun also takes down your sleep hormone levels. When you get into a&nbsp;darker place, it&nbsp;all rises again. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;stay active longer after a&nbsp;day on&nbsp;the beach, keep the lights bright indoors.</p><p>Cuddling, hugs and holding hands make you happier because they release the “feel good” hormones. They lift your mood, reduce stress, and also improve your immune system. Even seeing images of&nbsp;other people hugging can give you this effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/09d/bf6/4746535d3393f509524fa74c1b.png><p>Your skin gets wrinkled after five minutes in&nbsp;the water thanks to&nbsp;<a href=# title=evolution data-link=tag>evolution</a>. A&nbsp;long time ago, your ancestors needed a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;grip in&nbsp;both wet and dry conditions. So&nbsp;their skin adapted to&nbsp;look like a&nbsp;tiny river drainage system. Little streams on&nbsp;your skin unite into larger channels that flow into a&nbsp;central river, driving water away from your fingers and toes after long contact with water.</p><p>You feel the instinct to&nbsp;stretch your arms over your head first thing in&nbsp;the morning to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;your muscles. They lose tone overnight and there’s fluid moving along your back. When you stretch, the fluid goes back where it&nbsp;belongs.</p><p>It&nbsp;also helps your heart get back into its normal work mode after a&nbsp;night of&nbsp;pumping at&nbsp;slower speeds. Cats and dogs also do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for the same reasons. You fall asleep faster in&nbsp;a&nbsp;colder room because it&nbsp;signals to&nbsp;your body it’s time to&nbsp;sleep. It&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;lose some heat when you get in&nbsp;bed to&nbsp;conserve energy on&nbsp;maintaining your temperature overnight. Cooler air also helps you sleep all night without waking up&nbsp;and boosts your <a href=# title=metabolism data-link=tag>metabolism</a>.</p><p>You sometimes see stars when you stand up&nbsp;from lying down or&nbsp;sitting because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden drop in&nbsp;blood pressure. This drop messes up&nbsp;brain function for a&nbsp;brief moment. It&nbsp;can cause stars, flashing lights, bands of&nbsp;light, sparks or&nbsp;colorful rings. You can also see them after you rubbed your eyes or&nbsp;sneezed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3fe/850/481a715bcbb5d3bddd2ef64a8e.png><p>When you speak, you hear both the sound coming from the outside and conducted through your own vocal cords. The acoustics in&nbsp;your skull lowers the voice and adds some bass notes. When you hear your voice in&nbsp;recording, it&nbsp;seems higher and different because you lose these rich low frequencies. That’s why most people dislike the sound of&nbsp;their own voice. It’s just nothing like what you expected it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be.</p><p>You rarely like your own photos because of&nbsp;the mere exposure effect. It&nbsp;says the more you see something, the more you like&nbsp;it. When you look at&nbsp;yourself in&nbsp;the mirror, the image is&nbsp;reversed. You aren’t used to&nbsp;the real image and that’s why you don’t like&nbsp;it.</p><p>You get hangry&nbsp;— that’s hungry when angry&nbsp;— when your glucose levels drop. You get it&nbsp;from carbs, proteins and fats in&nbsp;your food. After some time passes, your brain is&nbsp;sending an&nbsp;SOS signal. It&nbsp;can’t function properly without glucose. One more reason for your hanger is&nbsp;that the same genes cause both hunger and anger. They must be&nbsp;in&nbsp;balance to&nbsp;keep you full and happy.</p><p>Your funny bone is&nbsp;a&nbsp;nerve that runs from your neck down to&nbsp;your hand. It’s well protected at&nbsp;all points along the way except for your elbow. It’s only covered by&nbsp;skin and fat there. That’s why when you hit your elbow it&nbsp;hurts so&nbsp;much. You’re hitting on&nbsp;the nerve, and the pain travels down the forearm and hand into your fingers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9bd/5cb/6476f5530594b27ccae0c2c2d9.png><p>The joy you feel about popping bubbly wrap has its roots in&nbsp;the human evolution. A&nbsp;long-long time ago, people spent most of&nbsp;their time running from predators. Now it’s all about sitting. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;muscle tension builds up&nbsp;because you hardly move. Popping bubble wrap is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the ways to&nbsp;release that tension. It&nbsp;takes down stress levels and releases feel-good chemicals. Like other kinds of&nbsp;fidgeting, it&nbsp;also increases your attention span and helps you remember what you learned better.</p><p>Your ear is&nbsp;especially sensitive to&nbsp;sounds in&nbsp;a&nbsp;high-pitch range. It’s built in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that they sound even louder to&nbsp;you. That’s why no&nbsp;one likes the sound of&nbsp;chalk scraping on&nbsp;a&nbsp;chalkboard. The disgust is&nbsp;stronger when you know it’s the sound of&nbsp;chalk. If&nbsp;someone tells you it’s contemporary music, you’ll perceive it&nbsp;as&nbsp;bearable. So&nbsp;it’s also a&nbsp;thing of&nbsp;habit.</p><p>Your legs and feet go&nbsp;numb or&nbsp;fall asleep after you keep them crossed, kneel, sit on&nbsp;the feet or&nbsp;wear pants, socks, or&nbsp;shoes that are too tight. That’s normal and happens because you put too much pressure on&nbsp;the nerves and limit the blood flow. Standing up&nbsp;and moving your legs is&nbsp;the easiest cure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5d7/bac/f931d254dfaa05a4a4678737d3.png><p>You often have a&nbsp;raspy voice in&nbsp;the morning when you didn’t get enough sleep. That’s because your vocal cords didn’t get enough rest and are slightly swollen. It&nbsp;also happens when you sleep in&nbsp;a&nbsp;room with dry air.</p><p>When you eat right before bed, your body has to&nbsp;digest food in&nbsp;your sleep. Stomach acid can travel where it&nbsp;doesn’t belong and mess up&nbsp;your vocal cords, too.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyfnJ6sXZa%2FpnnSnqWsoaSew6Z506hkpZ2XpMBurtStZKenpGK1orrDrGRxaWRpgXF7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
