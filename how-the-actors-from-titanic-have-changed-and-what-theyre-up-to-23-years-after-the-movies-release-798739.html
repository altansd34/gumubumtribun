Like the fact that the <a href=# title=Titanic data-link=tag>Titanic</a> sank or&nbsp;that the film adaptation of&nbsp;this story remains a&nbsp;major success that made millions of&nbsp;people cry in&nbsp;theatres. The movie is&nbsp;so&nbsp;good, it&nbsp;probably still affects many viewers to&nbsp;this day. But the truth&nbsp;is, aside from being tear-inducing, some things do&nbsp;change, like the actors who took part in&nbsp;this movie. What do&nbsp;you think they’ve been up&nbsp;to&nbsp;for the last 23&nbsp;years?</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> is&nbsp;very inquisitive, which is&nbsp;why we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;selection of&nbsp;13&nbsp;actors that appeared in&nbsp;<a href=#>Titanic</a>, so&nbsp;that you can see what they’re up&nbsp;to&nbsp;and how they look nowadays&nbsp;— 23&nbsp;years since the movie’s initial release.</p><p><h2>1. Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a7/5ef/0b81b25f7eabbcdc82a9938ca6.jpg><p><a href=# title="Leonardo DiCaprio" data-link=tag>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> won over many viewers thanks to&nbsp;his role as&nbsp;Jack Dawson, but his performance didn’t manage to&nbsp;capture the members of&nbsp;the Academy, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t get his hands on&nbsp;an&nbsp;Oscar that year&nbsp;— or&nbsp;any time soon after that, for that matter. He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;wait a&nbsp;whopping 18&nbsp;years to&nbsp;get the coveted statuette for his performance in&nbsp;<a href=#>The Revenant</a>. His latest hit was Tarantino’s <a href=#>Once Upon a&nbsp;Time in&nbsp;Hollywood</a>, in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;starred alongside <a href=# title="Brad Pitt" data-link=tag>Brad Pitt</a>, another iconic actor who made more than one fan swoon in&nbsp;the ’90s. That performance earned DiCaprio another Academy Award nomination.</p><p>Moreover, he&nbsp;remains a&nbsp;beloved and professional colleague. In&nbsp;fact, after winning a&nbsp;Golden Globe for Once Upon a&nbsp;Time in&nbsp;Hollywood, Brad Pitt did not hesitate to&nbsp;<a href=#>honor</a> his fellow actor by&nbsp;saying: “I&nbsp;also have to&nbsp;thank my&nbsp;partner in&nbsp;crime, LDC. I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;watch, year after year, his co-stars accept awards and get up&nbsp;and thank him profusely. Now I&nbsp;know why. He’s an&nbsp;all-star, he’s a&nbsp;gent, and&nbsp;I wouldn’t be&nbsp;here without you, man. I&nbsp;thank you.” But then he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;troll DiCaprio in&nbsp;the most elegant way by&nbsp;referring to&nbsp;Titanic: “Still, I&nbsp;would’ve shared the raft.” Yep, Brad, we&nbsp;all would have done the same. Except for Rose, that&nbsp;is.</p><p><h2>2. Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c9/57d/e26fc75121b737417d7b469602.jpg><p>Like her co-star, Winslet did not manage to&nbsp;win an&nbsp;Oscar for her performance in&nbsp;Titanic. She was still nominated for “Best Actress,” and that’s also a&nbsp;great achievement. She had to&nbsp;wait 11&nbsp;years to&nbsp;receive a&nbsp;well-deserved statuette, and that was for her role in&nbsp;the film, <a href=#>The Reader</a>. Currently, she’s <a href=#>married</a> to&nbsp;Edward Abel Smith (formerly known as&nbsp;Ned Rocknroll) and is&nbsp;still acting in&nbsp;various projects as&nbsp;she cares for her 3&nbsp;children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d72/20b/70c9365a9597d427f9df9ddc11.jpg><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and <a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a> remain friends to&nbsp;this day. In&nbsp;2017, they worked together in&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive fundraising <a href=#>campaign</a> to&nbsp;support efforts to&nbsp;combat <a href=# title="climate change" data-link=tag>climate change</a>. They also organized a&nbsp;private dinner to&nbsp;help a&nbsp;mother with <a href=# title="breast cancer" data-link=tag>breast cancer</a>.</p><p><h2>3. Billy Zane (Caledon Hockley)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/98f/3ec/cebf825fe690ee6a68aba2b9b5.jpg><p><a href=#>Billy Zane</a> delivered an&nbsp;amazing performance as&nbsp;Titanic’s most despicable villain. Hardly anyone would express sympathy for Caledon’s character after witnessing everything he&nbsp;did to&nbsp;keep Jack and Rose apart from each other. In&nbsp;any case, Zane is&nbsp;still acting in&nbsp;films and series such as&nbsp;<a href=#>Cliffs of&nbsp;Freedom</a> and Sky’s <a href=#>Curfew</a>. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;<a href=#>painter</a> and organizes exhibitions. Wouldn’t it&nbsp;be&nbsp;great to&nbsp;see one of&nbsp;his works? As&nbsp;for his personal life, he’s engaged to&nbsp;model Candice Neil, with whom he&nbsp;has 2&nbsp;children.</p><p><h2>4. Frances Fisher (Ruth DeWitt Bukater)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e35/403/19329358aab9aaff32dc05b5e1.jpg><p><h2>5. Kathy Bates (Margaret “Molly” Brown)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/981/ff9/21b3685f30928b5a4476449b3a.jpg><p>Kathy Bates played one of&nbsp;the most beloved characters in&nbsp;the film. She built a&nbsp;solid reputation as&nbsp;a&nbsp;trustworthy character, and throughout her career, she has managed to&nbsp;maintain the public’s affection with a&nbsp;great list of&nbsp;projects. Bates has not only played noble and humble characters, but she is&nbsp;also known for her role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;villain in&nbsp;productions like <a href=#>American Horror Story.</a></p><p>Now, at&nbsp;72, she is&nbsp;a&nbsp;proud <a href=#>survivor</a> of&nbsp;ovarian and breast cancer. This has inspired her to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;national spokesperson for <a href=#>lymphedema</a> and president of&nbsp;the Lymphatic Education &&nbsp;Research Network’s honorary board, in&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;a&nbsp;condition she suffers from due to&nbsp;her medical history. She has been praised for her important leadership in&nbsp;raising awareness of&nbsp;this disease.</p><p><h2>6. Victor Garber (Thomas Andrews)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/654/5c9/6911e8543e81bdfd150bb360a5.jpg><p>During the film, many of&nbsp;us felt sorry for the ship’s designer, Thomas Andrews, who witnessed his major work sink to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the Atlantic. Fortunately, nothing like that happened to&nbsp;<a href=#>Victor Garber</a>, the actor who played the role. Garber got married in&nbsp;2015 and his career is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;full swing. Today, he&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;carry on&nbsp;a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;acting and in&nbsp;<a href=#>music</a> as&nbsp;well. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;sings as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;he&nbsp;acts, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;great to&nbsp;hear some of&nbsp;his songs!</p><p><h2>7. Bernard Hill (Captain Edward J. Smith)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a7b/ab1/067e165aa69ef9603e32947dc4.jpg><p>Before the ship sank, Captain Edward J. Smith confirmed that this would be&nbsp;the last trip of&nbsp;his long career&nbsp;— however, this was not the case for actor <a href=#>Bernard Hill</a>, who played that role. After the positive reviews he&nbsp;received for his role in&nbsp;Titanic, his career continued to&nbsp;blossom. Today, he’s considered a&nbsp;very prestigious actor and has worked in&nbsp;several important productions. And just as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;he&nbsp;played the captain of&nbsp;a&nbsp;ship, he&nbsp;perfectly portrayed a&nbsp;king, <a href=#>Théoden</a> of&nbsp;Rohan in&nbsp;<a href=#>The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings</a>. He&nbsp;has also given his voice as&nbsp;a&nbsp;judge in&nbsp;the film, <a href=#>ParaNorman</a>. We’d expect nothing less from this great actor.</p><p><h2>8. Jonathan Hyde (Joseph Bruce Ismay)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a44/6d7/dab20f50529e0d5428835e11fb.jpg><p>All the common sense that Joseph Bruce Ismay’s character lacked, he&nbsp;made up&nbsp;for with his vanity. We&nbsp;can trace the sinking of&nbsp;the Titanic back to&nbsp;many of&nbsp;this character’s decisions. Of&nbsp;course, that also meant that the character wasn’t very popular in&nbsp;the story. However, as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;we&nbsp;blame Joseph, we&nbsp;all speak very highly of&nbsp;<a href=#>Jonathan Hyde</a>, the actor who played the character. Today, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;family man, having been married for 40&nbsp;years, and he’s still working in&nbsp;the film and theater industry. He&nbsp;has also given his voice to&nbsp;several animated characters such as&nbsp;Waltolomew Stricklander (or&nbsp;Walter Strickler) in&nbsp;<a href=#>Trollhunters: Tales of&nbsp;Arcadia</a>.</p><p><h2>9. Ioan Gruffudd (fifth officer Harold Lowe)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1dc/a45/009d4a538bb4f4682e29688e38.jpg><p><h2>10. Suzy Amis (Lizzy Calvert)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96b/d47/5ba7b358b88e34ae3b5621edca.jpg><p><a href=#>Suzy Amis</a>, who played Rose’s granddaughter, is&nbsp;the mother of&nbsp;4&nbsp;children and is&nbsp;married to&nbsp;the film’s director, <a href=#>James Cameron</a>. They tied the knot in&nbsp;2000 after working together on&nbsp;Titanic. She remains an&nbsp;important <a href=#>public figure</a>. She has founded organizations that are dedicated to&nbsp;raising awareness and fighting against climate change, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the promotion of&nbsp;food that does not harm the planet.</p><p><h2>11. Eric Braeden (John Jacob Astor&nbsp;IV)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5bb/105/5f8d5f5e2d9bbf1a7ed2c7f7db.jpg><p><a href=#>Eric Braeden</a>, who played one of&nbsp;the richest characters aboard the Titanic, is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;79-year-old married man and father of&nbsp;one child. Besides being an&nbsp;actor, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great athlete and plays tennis. He&nbsp;has also published an&nbsp;<a href=#>autobiography</a> in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;talks about how he&nbsp;was an&nbsp;actual survivor of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sinking ship. But, of&nbsp;course, that ship was not the Titanic, it&nbsp;was the <a href=#>MV&nbsp;Wilhelm Gustloff</a>.</p><p><h2>12. David Warner (Spicer Lovejoy)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/091/7a3/429a585021af354376a92f1f7b.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you haven’t seen this movie in&nbsp;a&nbsp;long time and don’t remember who Spicer Lovejoy was, we’ll try to&nbsp;refresh your memory: he&nbsp;was the cop who kept an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;Jack because he&nbsp;suspected that he&nbsp;wasn’t the honest person he&nbsp;was pretending to&nbsp;be. Surprisingly, Warner had already had the <a href=#>opportunity</a> to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;a&nbsp;previous film that told the story of&nbsp;the famous sinking ship. That must be&nbsp;why he&nbsp;delivered such a&nbsp;great performance! David Warner still acts on&nbsp;television and on&nbsp;the big screen, with one of&nbsp;his latest hits being <a href=#>Mary Poppins Returns</a>.</p><p><h2>13. Danny Nucci (Fabrizio)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b0c/d1b/a551515db3946506b73c04b3a8.jpg><p><a href=#>Danny Nucci</a>, an&nbsp;American actor with an&nbsp;Italian father and a&nbsp;French Moroccan mother, played Jack’s faithful sidekick and friend on&nbsp;the Titanic. He&nbsp;has been married to&nbsp;actress <a href=#>Paula Marshall</a> since 2003 and has 2&nbsp;daughters. He&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;films and successful series such as&nbsp;Criminal Minds and CSI.</p><p>Can you remember the emotions this movie evoked in&nbsp;you when you first saw&nbsp;it? Do&nbsp;you think there was enough room for Jack on&nbsp;the raft? Why? Let&nbsp;us know in&nbsp;the comments.</p><p>Kate Winslet shed light on&nbsp;the dynamics of&nbsp;filming intimate scenes with <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, especially in&nbsp;“Revolutionary Road.” Despite their close bond, Winslet found it&nbsp;challenging to&nbsp;film such scenes in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;her then-husband, director Sam Mendes. DiCaprio, however, saw their friendship as&nbsp;a&nbsp;driving force behind their powerful performances.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ytn55lkZjBsL7SZp2rp51iwarAwKegnGWYlsOmecKhmKeflZl6orrDZq6hmaRiwamx2KucZq2gYsGweZFsZLKdkafAbq3FrZyrZaSdsm65zq%2Bgnqtdp7KtscCsnGZvaW2EdIWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
