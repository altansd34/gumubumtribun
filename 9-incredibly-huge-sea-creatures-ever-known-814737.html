While nearly&nbsp;95% of&nbsp;our oceans haven’t been explored yet, it’s hard not to&nbsp;let your <a href=# title=imagination data-link=tag>imagination</a> run wild. But thanks to&nbsp;brave explorers, deep-sea cameras, and awesome archaeologists, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;know about some pretty incredible sea creatures living in&nbsp;our waters today...and millions of&nbsp;years ago.</p><p>From the 9-ft [2.7&nbsp;m] spider crab to&nbsp;the 60-ft [18&nbsp;m] prehistoric Megalodon, these sea dwellers come in&nbsp;all shapes and sizes! But let’s focus on&nbsp;sea creatures famous for their huge size.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/713/0fe/076e315401abe2897d1262df0e.png><p>Can you guess which living species of&nbsp;whale is&nbsp;the largest? Well, it’s not the orca, but that’s a&nbsp;good guess. The orca is&nbsp;a&nbsp;toothed whale that can grow to&nbsp;anywhere from 23&nbsp;ft to&nbsp;32&nbsp;ft [7&nbsp;m to&nbsp;9.8&nbsp;m], which is&nbsp;slightly smaller than a&nbsp;school bus. How about the narwhal? Nope, they’re not the biggest either! These “unicorns of&nbsp;the sea” live mainly in&nbsp;arctic waters and only grow 13&nbsp;ft to&nbsp;20&nbsp;ft [4&nbsp;m to&nbsp;6&nbsp;m] in&nbsp;length&nbsp;— and that’s including their 9&nbsp;ft [2.7&nbsp;m] tusk.</p><p>Tired of&nbsp;guessing? OK, I&nbsp;give&nbsp;in! The largest whale that still exists today is&nbsp;the blue whale. At&nbsp;a&nbsp;jaw-dropping 82&nbsp;ft to&nbsp;105&nbsp;ft [25&nbsp;m to&nbsp;32&nbsp;m], the blue whale is&nbsp;not only the biggest whale we&nbsp;know of&nbsp;but is&nbsp;currently the largest animal to&nbsp;have ever lived on&nbsp;Earth. Seriously! These animals are bigger than a&nbsp;T-Rex and even the prehistoric Megalodon!</p><p>If&nbsp;you were to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;blue whale next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;school bus, it&nbsp;would look like it&nbsp;could swallow&nbsp;it. Think about that! According to&nbsp;National Geographic, a&nbsp;blue whale’s tongue can weigh the same as&nbsp;an&nbsp;elephant, and their hearts can weigh as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;a&nbsp;car. That doesn’t even sound possible! It’s no&nbsp;wonder these giants need to&nbsp;eat about 4&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;krill every day!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a6b/521/1e831c57359823fc2306f693ef.png><p>While there aren’t too many animals living today that can compete with the blue whale’s epic proportions, there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;entirely different species that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good contender, and it’s not quite what you would expect: it’s a&nbsp;jellyfish! No, I’m not talking about the little jellyfish that wash up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the shore and ruin a&nbsp;perfectly good day at&nbsp;the beach. I’m referring to&nbsp;the lion’s mane jellyfish, the biggest jellyfish around!</p><p>This invertebrate can grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;120&nbsp;ft long [36.6&nbsp;m]!! They also come in&nbsp;different gorgeous colors like red, purple, or&nbsp;even shades of&nbsp;orange. And as&nbsp;if&nbsp;their length wasn’t impressive, the lion’s mane jellyfish boast a&nbsp;whopping 8&nbsp;sets of&nbsp;70&nbsp;to&nbsp;150 tentacles...that means they can have up&nbsp;to&nbsp;1,200 in&nbsp;total! And here’s the Giant Oceanic Manta Ray&nbsp;— the largest type of&nbsp;ray in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>Their “wingspan” can be&nbsp;longer than a&nbsp;bus! These guys can reach 30&nbsp;ft [9,1&nbsp;m] in&nbsp;length. They also have the biggest brain compared to&nbsp;body size among all fish. Unlike their stingray cousins, mantas don’t have venomous tails. And while the lion’s mane jellyfish and the blue whale are yet to&nbsp;be&nbsp;beaten for the longest sea creature, there is&nbsp;one marine creature that can grow even larger in&nbsp;length. The Portuguese Physalia Physalis, tentacles and all, can reach a&nbsp;length of&nbsp;165&nbsp;ft long [50&nbsp;m], and that’s according to&nbsp;mentalfloss.com!</p><p>While this thing may look a&nbsp;lot like a&nbsp;jellyfish, it’s actually known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;siphonophore, and there are hundreds and sometimes thousands of&nbsp;them that are genetically identical. Their long tentacles help the organism catch prey, and its sting is&nbsp;fatal to&nbsp;most animals&nbsp;— even humans in&nbsp;some cases. What’s even creepier is&nbsp;that if&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the tentacles comes off the organism for whatever reason, it&nbsp;can float around the water for days before decomposing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/010/b66/00929c5a44a9fa43b0df9e8d04.png><p>Even if&nbsp;it’s detached, this tentacle can still sting you! But don’t go&nbsp;running out of&nbsp;the ocean just yet. Your chances of&nbsp;being hurt by&nbsp;a&nbsp;Portuguese Physalia Physalis sting are pretty slim. However, if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;get stung, the side effects aren’t pretty, with welts, stomach cramps, an&nbsp;elevated heart rate, and an&nbsp;upset stomach. While you don’t want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;anywhere near these long creatures, they sure are pretty to&nbsp;look&nbsp;at. Check out all those colors!</p><p>The Shastasaurus is&nbsp;the biggest marine reptile that has ever existed. These predators lived during the Late Triassic Period about 210 million years ago. These amazing giants could reach lengths of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;69&nbsp;ft [21&nbsp;m] and weighed more than 75&nbsp;tons. This made the Shastasaurus as&nbsp;heavy as&nbsp;a&nbsp;blue whale. And if&nbsp;you could stand this creature up&nbsp;vertically, it’d be&nbsp;as&nbsp;tall as&nbsp;a&nbsp;7-story building! Despite appearances, the Shastasaurus was actually pretty slim for its size; its ribcage was only 6&nbsp;ft [2&nbsp;m] across.</p><p>You’d think that this big guy was chowing down on&nbsp;other dinosaurs, but that’s not the case at&nbsp;all! This reptile survived on&nbsp;a&nbsp;diet that consisted of&nbsp;small fish and cephalopods, like octopuses and squids. The Albertonectes is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright representative of&nbsp;the Plesiosaur family, meaning that this marine reptile had a&nbsp;small head on&nbsp;an&nbsp;incredibly long neck and large flipper-like limbs that helped it&nbsp;move through the water. These creatures occupied the seas around North America 76&nbsp;to&nbsp;70&nbsp;million years ago.</p><p>The length of&nbsp;this “sea monster” could reach 38&nbsp;ft [11.5&nbsp;m], with its neck taking up&nbsp;23&nbsp;feet [7&nbsp;m] of&nbsp;that length. Its neck was a&nbsp;true record-breaker; it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;whopping 76&nbsp;bones in&nbsp;it! No&nbsp;other animal known to&nbsp;humankind has had so&nbsp;many vertebrae in&nbsp;its neck. Scientists aren’t sure why they needed such a&nbsp;lengthy neck. They might have used it&nbsp;to&nbsp;collect shellfish off the seabed, or&nbsp;perhaps it&nbsp;helped them capture their main prey, fish and squids. This aquatic reptile also had gastroliths in&nbsp;its stomachs; some of&nbsp;them were as&nbsp;big as&nbsp;5.5 inches [14&nbsp;cm] in&nbsp;diameter!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d6c/049/9838fd5d3a97116104c1dd2b0d.png><p>The Tylosaurus belonged to&nbsp;the Mosasaur family. It&nbsp;dominated the shallow seas of&nbsp;North America about 85&nbsp;to&nbsp;80&nbsp;million years ago. This was an&nbsp;enormous predator, with the biggest representatives reaching 45&nbsp;ft [13&nbsp;m] in&nbsp;length. It&nbsp;had a&nbsp;narrow hydrodynamic body with a&nbsp;blunt powerful head that the animal used to&nbsp;ram and stun its prey. Its body was equipped with agile flippers and a&nbsp;long tail decorated with a&nbsp;maneuverable fin. The Tylosaurus was a&nbsp;carnivore, and its diet included not only fish, turtles, and small sharks but also other mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and flightless birds!</p><p>Meet Ophthalmosaurus! This prehistoric reptile thrived during the late Jurassic period and lived in&nbsp;oceans all over the world. Ophthalmosaurus weighed somewhere around 6,000&nbsp;lb [2,722&nbsp;kg] and grew to&nbsp;approximately 16&nbsp;ft long [4.9&nbsp;m], according to&nbsp;newdinosaurs.com&nbsp;— that’s about the same length as&nbsp;the beluga whale that exists today.</p><p>It’s too bad these guys went extinct before we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;see them ourselves as&nbsp;their cartoonish wide eyes and dolphin-like features are pretty darn cute. Of&nbsp;course the Ophthalmosaurus evolved over time to&nbsp;become Ophthalmologists&nbsp;— or&nbsp;eye doctors that we&nbsp;know today. No, that’s a&nbsp;lie. Just testing you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/83b/fe3/d88b6d52d89cdfd5bcfbcbc1dd.png><p>The Mosasaurus is&nbsp;a&nbsp;truly gigantic predator that dominated the seas all over the world about 66&nbsp;million years ago. According to&nbsp;fossil evidence, some specimens could be&nbsp;more than 50&nbsp;feet [15&nbsp;m] in&nbsp;length. This fact makes the Mosasaurus the biggest marine carnivore of&nbsp;its time.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the most terrifying things about this creature was its crocodile-like head, decorated with literally hundreds of&nbsp;razor-sharp teeth neatly organized in&nbsp;two rows on&nbsp;both jaws. The thing is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;was pretty challenging for the Mosasaurus to&nbsp;grab its prey in&nbsp;the water. That’s why it&nbsp;had all these teeth, plus something special: pterygoid teeth anchored to&nbsp;the bones on&nbsp;the roof of&nbsp;its mouth! This made hunting and holding onto its prey much easier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8ca/979/964e3f5f27a656a5a53dc8b6a5.png><p>The Styxosaurus belonged to&nbsp;the Plesiosaur family and lived during the Late Cretaceous Period, around 85&nbsp;to&nbsp;70&nbsp;million years ago. Upon first glance at&nbsp;this dinosaur, you might mistake it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;sea snake, and it’d be&nbsp;an&nbsp;honest mistake! Styxosauruses were about 35&nbsp;ft [10.6&nbsp;m] in&nbsp;length, but over 16&nbsp;feet of&nbsp;that consisted just of&nbsp;their long snake-like neck! They had a&nbsp;comparatively small body and weighed approximately 4&nbsp;tons.</p><p>Their mouths were full of&nbsp;razor-sharp cone-shaped teeth that they used to&nbsp;catch fish. They didn’t need to&nbsp;chew their prey thanks to&nbsp;the 200 small stones called gastroliths in&nbsp;their bellies that probably aided in&nbsp;digestion. At&nbsp;the same time, some scientists believe that the Styxosaurus used these stones to&nbsp;sink to&nbsp;the ocean bottom in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;particular types of&nbsp;fish. Hmm, looks kinda like Nessie to&nbsp;me...</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZutc2cqZ6cmZe5unnHrp6eZaOarm6v0Z6Yra2imsBusdWeqWajnqTEr3mXamtwa2dk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
