The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>former</a> Fifth Harmony star revealed that the purse had transformed during the event. "It was a purse," she said, "but then it broke about 5 minutes into being in line, so I called my stylist like, ‘What do I do?’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5af/436/bffd595c9cadfb30e882237d6a.jpg><p>ANGELA WEISS/AFP/East News</p><p>With some quick thinking, Cabello decided to hold the remaining piece like a clutch and remarked, "We're just trying things here."</p><p>The clutch wasn't just a block of ice. Designed by Jane Wade, it also featured a copper rose, echoing the single flower on the gala's invitations, tying into the overall theme beautifully.</p><p>Cabello's outfit included more nods to the theme of "beauty in decay." Her stunning gown, designed by <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ludovic de Saint Sernin</a>, weighed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>15 pounds</a> and was adorned with 250,000 Swarovski crystals. The dress had intentional rips at the bottom, linking back to her theme of impermanence. To complete her look, she wore iridescent makeup and styled her hair in a "wet" ponytail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/460/594/f26aa45de4b5ffe613c0ace6af.jpg><p>The "Señorita"<i> </i>singer had the gala's "Garden of Time" <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>theme</a> in mind when assembling her outfit, but she was also inspired by something else — her upcoming album, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>C,XOXO</i></a>, set to release on June 28.</p><p>"It's Miami-themed," she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> with <i>Variety,</i> "so we're dripping, we're wet." This statement not only ties back to her album's theme, but also cleverly connects with her look and the gala's overall ambiance.</p><p>Fans were quick to react to Camila Cabello's unique ice purse, noticing that it was actually made from real ice as droplets visibly fell from it. Many initially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mistook</a> it for glass until they saw the melting. Concerned comments also emerged, with fans asking about the comfort of her hand, wondering, "Is your hand doing okay?" and even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>humorously questioning</a>, "How did your hand not fall off?" <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>One fan</a> expressed admiration, exclaiming, "You are incredible! How could you even hold the ice for such a long time?"</p><p>The 2024 Met Gala featured the theme "The Garden of Time," inspired by J.G. Ballard's 1962 story. Celebrities wore outfits that highlighted the brief and changing nature of beauty and time. <a href=#>Check out more outfits here</a>.</p><p>Preview photo credit ANGELA WEISS/AFP/East News<span>, </span>ANGELA WEISS/AFP/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLCiucilmGabkZeyrbjOZqmerpWWubR506GcZq2emsWxscKtnJ1lmaPAsbXRmquip55ir6a0yKebZqCVp3qqr8RmmaWnk6B6scHRrJxmmZ6ZerGxzqmjnmWTlru1eceeo6llkqrBbrrOraCcnV2ku6Z5w56rmqGcYoVyhJdvcGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
