Cluster analysis requires some human decisions and input, including which features to include in analysis and method of choice.“Features” refers to the existing variables that were selected to be used in the cluster analysis.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0">Morning Consult data scientists used partitioning around medoids (PAM), also known as k-medoids, to develop the clusters in this report. This cluster analysis method is robust, with the ability to include outliers and allow users to input exclusively quantitative or mixed features.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0">The PAM analysis develops clusters by placing respondents into relatively homogenous groups based on distances between responses to the selected features. For this report, the features were selected for the cluster analysis with the intent to sort respondents based on their experiences with and perspectives on work, as well as how they value work in their lives. Throughout this report, the results of a five-cluster PAM model with mixed feature inputs are used for analysis.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0">Some of the research shown here is also from Morning Consult’s Return to Normal project—which polls 2,200 U.S. adults every week on issues connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. All interviews were conducted online, and the data was weighted to approximate respective populations of adults based on gender, educational attainment, race and region.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0">Topline results from the January survey have a margin of error of +/-1 percentage point.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqq1lopq9sL7TrGafraSqv6Z5zp9ksKeioHpzfJFr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
