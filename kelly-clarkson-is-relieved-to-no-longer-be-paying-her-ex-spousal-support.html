It’s so nice knowing that this chapter of her life can close with the new year.”</p><p>Clarkson filed for divorce from Blackstock in 2020, and the couple eventually settled in 2022. The singer agreed to pay her ex $115,000 in monthly spousal support until January 2024. She also agreed to pay $45,601 a month in child support&nbsp;until the couple’s two children either turn 18, graduate high school, or become self-supporting.</p><p>Blackstock also served as Clarkson’s manager during their marriage.

Blackstock also reportedly told her that the show wanted a Black coach “to have a diverse thing,” and argued that she and former coach Blake Shelton were “too similar.”</p><p>When Clarkson’s lawyer Ed McPherson asked how she was able to remember her conversation with Blackstock, the singer responded, “Well, a wife doesn’t forget a time she gets told she’s not a sex symbol, so that stays.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_ChristinaAguilera_Taylor-HillGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Christina Aguilera Kicks Off Her Las Vegas Residency Following Weight Loss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>brandon blackstock</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlmah6s7HLopyvnZRiwbB5zahkpaeenLKzecGeZKmZqZ67qHnHnqlmnahiwLG71KyYpWWjqr2xu9GtZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
