Musk has reportedly long had a fascination with the letter X, with his X.com being one of first business ventures – while the company was later merged with PayPal, he retained the domain name, which now redirects to Twitter.</p><p data-block-key=kgnah>A new YouGov poll shows that two thirds of Twitter users (67%) have reacted negatively to the new ‘X’ branding, including 41% who feel “very negatively” about the change. These figures are about the same among the platform’s most frequent users.</p><p data-block-key=dox0s>Just 4% of all users feel positively about the rebranding to ‘X’, while 21% are indifferent.</p><h3 data-block-key=ctbuo>The British public, as well as Twitter users, take an increasingly negative view of Elon Musk</h3><p data-block-key=q9bhy>Since our first poll in April last year – shortly after Musk initiated his acquisition of Twitter – recognition of the tech tycoon has increased significantly. Back then, 63% of Britons had an opinion on Elon Musk; now 79% do.</p><p data-block-key=d72bq>This has been a case of familiarity breeding contempt, however. While 40% of Britons had an unfavourable view of Musk in April 2022, this figure had increased to 54% in December, and to 61% now.</p><p data-block-key=ao6qn>About one in five Britons (19%) have a favourable opinion of the Twitter owner, about the same as it was in December (18%), but lower than his starting figure of 23% in April.</p><p data-block-key=gankv>Musk’s favourability among Twitter users has likewise been declined. Among all users, 27% had a favourable view and 49% an unfavourable one in April 2022. Those figures now stand at 20% and 67% respectively.</p><p data-block-key=zyxu9>Among daily users, Musk’s favourability has dropped from 29% in April last year to 21% now, while the number with a negative view has risen from 50% to 67%.</p><h3 data-block-key=fwx1i id="twitter's-own-reputation-has-declined-since-elon-musk-started-to-acquire-the-platform">Twitter’s own reputation has declined since Elon Musk started to acquire the platform</h3><p data-block-key=99zzw>Most Britons (54%) have a negative view of Twitter itself, up from 50% in December and 45% in April 2022. The proportion with a positive view remains the same as last time (21%), although this is down from 26% in our first poll.</p><p data-block-key=b4kkg>Among daily Twitter users, two thirds continue to have a favourable view of the platform (67%, from 72% in spring 2022), but the number with an unfavourable view has increased from 27% to 33%.</p><p data-block-key=qils2>Among all users, favourability has fallen from 51% to 40%, while negativity has increased from 35% to 48%.</p><h3 data-block-key=h45i7>Twitter users increasingly say there is too much free speech on the platform</h3><p data-block-key=6ye4h>When Musk acquired Twitter, he made clear his desire to promote greater freedom of speech on the platform.</p><p data-block-key=1lke0>Even at the time, however, there was a tendency among Twitter users to believe the platform gave people too much freedom to post offensive and harmful content. One in three users in April 2022 (37%) said so, compared to only 14% taking the opposing view that Twitter did not give people enough freedom to post what they want. A quarter (27%) thought the platform got the balance right.</p><p data-block-key=a5a00>Following 15 months with Musk at the helm, Twitter users are even more inclined to think the platform gives people too much leeway to post what they want, at 47%. Only 21% now think Twitter gets the balance right, while 13% say freedom of speech is not strong enough on the platform.</p><h3 data-block-key=e1enk>Most Twitter users say that Musk’s takeover has been bad for the platform</h3><p data-block-key=2pcye>The public continue to think that Elon Musk buying Twitter has been bad for the social network. More than four in ten say so (44%), up from 38% in December. About the same number say it has been neither good nor bad as last time (18%), while just 4% think Musk’s ownership has been good for Twitter (from 8% in December).</p><p data-block-key=j50rl>Twitter users are even more convinced the takeover was a bad move: 55% of all users, including 59% of daily users say so. In April 2022, only 30-32% had expected this would be the case.</p><h3 data-block-key=hxerx>How has Twitter usage changed in the last year?</h3><p data-block-key=dnqb2>Asked how frequently they used Twitter 12 months ago, and today, a quarter of people who say they were using Twitter a year ago say they’re using it less today than they were at the time (25%). They are partly counteracted by the 15% who say they are using it more than before. Most (59%) say that they are using it about the same as they were. Few (4%) say they no longer use the platform at all, again balanced by the 3% of current Twitter users say they joined the platform in the last year.</p><p data-block-key=cygr3>Eight in ten of those who used Twitter on a daily basis last year (80%) say they continue to do so, with a further 10% continuing to use the platform multiple times per week. Only 2% say they have no longer visit the social network.</p><p data-block-key=l43qe><a href=#><b>See the full results</b></a></p><p data-block-key=a0v7i><i>Photo: Getty</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwaavx6empaeXrnyivtOimqWdo2SBdoWTbGStr5mpwaa%2BjK6qnqqjYravr9GemKyhnpy5unnNnp6arJmrsm6twaisrWWVobyvecyuqg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
