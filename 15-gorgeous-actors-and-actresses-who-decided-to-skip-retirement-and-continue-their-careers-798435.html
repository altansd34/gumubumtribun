And this is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;especially true for women. But talent doesn’t depend on&nbsp;age and this was proven by&nbsp;many celebrities who have left their younger years far behind, but who never lost their charisma and charm. And the passing years bring the necessary experience and wisdom that help them deal better with difficult roles.</p><p>We&nbsp;at<strong>&nbsp;Bright Side </strong>are delighted with these actors and actresses, who clearly prove that age is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;number on&nbsp;your birth certificate, and who continue to&nbsp;delight viewers with their new roles.</p><p><h2>1. Anthony Hopkins</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/929/5b2/82ab8e58a2ace964a20a8a1ad8.jpg><p>Anthony <a href=#>got</a> his first acting job in&nbsp;1967, when he&nbsp;was 30&nbsp;years old, but real success came to&nbsp;the actor after the film The Silence of&nbsp;the Lambs was released. Today, <a href=# title="Anthony Hopkins" data-link=tag>Anthony Hopkins</a> is&nbsp;82&nbsp;years old, and he&nbsp;recently wrapped up&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the main roles in&nbsp;the film The Two Popes, and in&nbsp;2020, we’ll see him in&nbsp;the premiere of&nbsp;the film <a href=#>The Father</a>.</p><p><h2>2. Meryl Streep</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f4/485/b66d81573f8c66488f6860c7b4.jpg><p><a href=# title="Meryl Streep" data-link=tag>Meryl Streep</a> is&nbsp;rightfully <a href=#>called</a> one of&nbsp;the greatest actresses of&nbsp;our time. She started her career in&nbsp;theater when she was about 20&nbsp;years old, but then she switched her attention to&nbsp;cinema, and since then she has managed to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge number of&nbsp;films. The actress has 3&nbsp;<a href=#>Oscar awards</a> for her work. At&nbsp;the moment, Meryl Streep is&nbsp;71&nbsp;years old, but she actively continues her acting career. Last year alone, 3&nbsp;major projects in&nbsp;which she participated were released, including the&nbsp;TV series Big Little Lies and the film Little Women.</p><p><h2>3. Michael Douglas</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/029/4b4/5cbec35ef0a2100e152ebc6052.jpg><p>The son of&nbsp;the legendary actor Kirk Douglas first appeared on&nbsp;screen at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;25, but he&nbsp;<a href=#>became</a> famous after the series The Streets of&nbsp;San Francisco. This was followed by&nbsp;an&nbsp;equally successful role in&nbsp;the thriller Coma. Now, Douglas has more than 60&nbsp;films in&nbsp;his filmography, and the actor continues to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;the new projects. We’d especially like to&nbsp;mention his work in&nbsp;the series The Kominsky Method, where Michael plays the main role.</p><p><h2>4. Helen Mirren</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/787/15f/03849f517ebea3cc14e94efe1a.jpg><p>Having started her way to&nbsp;fame at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;24, Helen has proven that she can <a href=#>play</a> even the most diverse roles. And the older Helen has become, the more charismatic roles she’s been offered. Just last year, the 73-year-old actress took part in&nbsp;3&nbsp;major projects, among which was the role of&nbsp;Catherine the Great.</p><p><h2>5. Jonathan Pryce</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/426/e07/a1d486517dacd1f69e025f69c4.jpg><p>British actor Jonathan Pryce <a href=#>started</a> his career at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;29, and he&nbsp;has acted in&nbsp;over 70&nbsp;films since then. Moreover, Jonathan became known to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wide audience at&nbsp;an&nbsp;older age&nbsp;— he&nbsp;gained massive popularity after his role as&nbsp;the High Sparrow, in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series Game of&nbsp;Thrones, which was followed by&nbsp;equally successful roles in&nbsp;the films The Wife and The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.</p><p><h2>6. Jane Fonda</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c25/6b4/da70715879a9f30cc85d82ce01.jpg><p>A&nbsp;true fan of&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle, <a href=#>Jane Fonda</a> looks great even at&nbsp;80+&nbsp;years old. Apparently, aerobics and fitness have allowed her to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;excellent shape and continue to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;leading roles. Today, Fonda plays one of&nbsp;the main roles in&nbsp;the series Grace and Frankie, which was renewed for its 7th season in&nbsp;2019.</p><p><h2>7.

Today, the legendary actor is&nbsp;76&nbsp;years old and he&nbsp;isn’t going to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;his position anytime soon, his most recent work in&nbsp;Martin Scorsese’s film The Irishman proves this.</p><p><h2>8. Maggie Smith</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/373/729/92a9e45f66972cf4874785cbc6.jpg><p>Despite the fact that Maggie Smith first <a href=#>appeared</a> on&nbsp;the screen at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;21, her real popularity came a&nbsp;little later&nbsp;— after the film The Prime of&nbsp;Miss Jean Brodie. During her long career, the actress has won <a href=#>an&nbsp;Oscar</a> twice. Today, Maggie Smith is&nbsp;85&nbsp;years old, and her fans were able to&nbsp;recently enjoy her work in&nbsp;the movie Downton Abbey.</p><p><h2>9.

Fortunately, other directors discovered his great potential and began to&nbsp;offer him a&nbsp;wide variety of&nbsp;roles. At&nbsp;the same time, a&nbsp;wide audience remembers Sutherland as&nbsp;the insidious President Snow from The Hunger Games trilogy. Today, Donald is&nbsp;85&nbsp;years old and he’s full of&nbsp;energy&nbsp;— last year the actor starred in&nbsp;several films, and soon, we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;appreciate another film of&nbsp;his&nbsp;— <a href=#>The Burnt Orange Heresy</a>.</p><p><h2>10. Diane Keaton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d72/556/b964dd517fab59fb893c787a15.jpg><p>Oscar <a href=#>winner</a> Diane Keaton made her film debut in&nbsp;The Godfather at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;26.

Michael Caine</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e1/653/dc9af058b6898762e58eb2e94a.jpg><p>Few people know that this famous <a href=#>actor</a> went through the Korean War and miraculously survived. After the service, Michael decided to&nbsp;connect his life with cinema, but his first experience wasn’t very successful&nbsp;— he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;the film <a href=#>Carve Her Name With Pride</a> but his name wasn’t even mentioned in&nbsp;the credits. Real success came to&nbsp;Caine after his role in&nbsp;the film Zulu. Since then, the actor has played more than 130 roles and continues to&nbsp;act to&nbsp;this day.</p><p><h2>12. Morgan Freeman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc2/156/91b8c6580f8dac9b0484e575f5.jpg><p>Morgan Freeman’s career didn’t <a href=#>develop</a> very quickly&nbsp;— his debut wasn’t very bright and afterward, the actor took a&nbsp;small career break. Success came to&nbsp;Freeman after his role in&nbsp;the movie Street Smart, for which he&nbsp;was nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar. Currently, the 83-year-old actor has more than 100 roles in&nbsp;his filmography, and he&nbsp;recently delighted fans with his performance in&nbsp;the film Angel Has Fallen.</p><p><h2>13.

Ian McKellen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/563/879/faf36254e6951330d100a5ff0e.jpg><p>We&nbsp;know <a href=#>Ian</a> as&nbsp;the white magician of&nbsp;Middle-Earth, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the powerful Magneto from The X-Men.

After a&nbsp;small role in&nbsp;the film The Panic in&nbsp;Needle Park, Pacino was noticed by&nbsp;Francis Coppola, who invited him to&nbsp;audition for the role of&nbsp;Michael Corleone. Since then, Al&nbsp;Pacino has become a&nbsp;real star and in&nbsp;his 80s, he&nbsp;still continues to&nbsp;delight&nbsp;us with his bright work.

It’s not surprising that Walken has over 100 different projects in&nbsp;his collection of&nbsp;roles. Christopher Walken is&nbsp;now 77&nbsp;years old, but he&nbsp;is&nbsp;clearly in&nbsp;no&nbsp;hurry to&nbsp;retire.
