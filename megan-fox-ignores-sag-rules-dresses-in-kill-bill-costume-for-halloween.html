Fox chose to ignore this guidance, dressing up as Kill Bill character Gogo Yubari while her boyfriend Machine Gun Kelly wore a costume inspired by Uma Thurman’s character The Bride.</p><p>Fox posted photos of their costumes on social media over the weekend, making it clear that she was deliberately flouting SAG’s rules by tagging the union in her Instagram post.</p><p>“Why is she being defiant to a group that’s literally fighting for her to make a fair wage,” wrote <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one commenter</a> on Fox’s post, while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another wrote</a>, “Yes girl give it to your union trying to get better wages and benefits for lesser known people than u!”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN, MEGAN FOX CO-PARENT KIDS AMID INSANE SCHEDULE</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-are-surprised-they-re-still-together>Fans Are Surprised They’re Still Together</h3><p>Commenters who weren’t expressing their disappointment in Fox for ignoring her union’s rules were expressing their surprise that she and Machine Gun Kelly are still together.
